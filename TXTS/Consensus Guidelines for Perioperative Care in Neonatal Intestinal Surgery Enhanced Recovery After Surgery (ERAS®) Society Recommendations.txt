   Abstract
   Background Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERASÒ) Society guidelines integrate evidence-based practices into
   multimodal care pathways that have improved outcomes in multiple adult surgical specialties. There are currently no
   pediatric ERASÒ Society guidelines. We created an ERASÒ guideline designed to enhance quality of care in
   neonatal intestinal resection surgery.
   Methods A multidisciplinary guideline generation group deﬁned the scope, population, and guideline topics. Systematic
   reviews were supplemented by targeted searching and expert identiﬁcation to identify 3514 publications that were screened
   to develop and support recommendations. Final recommendations were determined through consensus and were assessed
   for evidence quality and recommendation strength. Parental input was attained throughout the process.
   Results Final recommendations ranged from communication strategies to antibiotic use. Topics with poor-quality
   and conﬂicting evidence were eliminated. Several recommendations were combined. The quality of supporting
   evidence was variable. Seventeen ﬁnal recommendations are included in the proposed guideline.
   Discussion We have developed a comprehensive, evidence-based ERAS guideline for neonates undergoing intestinal
   resection surgery. This guideline, and its creation process, provides a foundation for future ERAS guideline
   development and can ultimately lead to improved perioperative care across a variety of pediatric surgical specialties.
