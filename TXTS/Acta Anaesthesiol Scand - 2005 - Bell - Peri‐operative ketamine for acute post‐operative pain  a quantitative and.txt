Background: Post-operative pain management is usually lim-
ited by adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting. Adjuvant
treatment with an inexpensive opioid-sparing drug such as
ketamine may be of value in giving better analgesia with fewer
adverse effects. The objective of this systematic review was to
evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of ketamine adminis-
tered peri-operatively in the treatment of acute post-operative
pain in adults.
Methods: Studies were identified from MEDLINE (1966—2004),
EMBASE (1980—2004), the Cochrane Library (2004) and by hand
searching reference lists from review articles and trials. The
manufacturer of ketamine (Pfizer AS, Lysaker, Norway) pro-
vided search results from their in-house database, PARDLARS.
Randomized and controlled trials (RCTs) of adult patients
undergoing surgery, being treated with peri-operative ketamine,
placebo or an active control were considered for inclusion.
Results: Eighteen trials were excluded. Thirty-seven trials were
included. Twenty-seven out of 37 trials found that peri-operativeketamine reduced rescue analgesic requirements or pain inten-
sity, or both. Quantitative analysis showed that treatment with
ketamine reduced 24-h patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) mor-
phine consumption and post-operative nausea and vomiting
(PONV). Adverse effects were mild or absent.
Conclusion: In the first 24 h after surgery, ketamine reduces
morphine requirements. Ketamine also reduces PONV.
Adverse effects are mild or absent. These data should be inter-
preted with caution as the retrieved studies were heterogenous
and the result of the meta-analysis can not be translated into any
specific administration regimen with ketamine.

ADVERSE effects such as nausea and vomiting
often limit post-operative pain management.
Adjuvant treatment with opioid-sparing drugs
such as ketamine may be of value in giving better
analgesia with fewer adverse effects (1).
Ketamine is a phencyclidine derivative developed
in the 1960s as a general anaesthetic. Ketamine
hydrochloride is given intravenously or intramus-
cularly for surgical anaesthesia. Ketamine is also
used as an adjuvant to opioids in the treatment of
refractory pain in cancer patients (2), in the treat-
ment of neuropathic pain (3), and in the treatment of
acute post-operative pain (1), although not licensed
for these conditions. For post-operative pain, keta-
mine may be administered before incision, after
incision, or in the post-operative period, and is
usually given as an adjuvant to systemic opioid,for example PCA (patient-controlled analgesia).
Routes of administration include intravenous,
subcutaneous, epidural, transdermal and intra-
articular. Ketamine was previously only available
as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, S( þ) and
R(—) ketamine. The S( þ) isomer has been shown to
be approximately twice as potent as the racemic
mixture (4). S( þ) ketamine has recently been
approved for clinical use in countries such as
Finland and Germany. Clinical use of ketamine is
limited due to psychotomimetic adverse effects such
as hallucinations and bad dreams. Other common
adverse effects are dizziness, blurred vision, and
nausea and vomiting.
Opioids are traditionally used as a part of general
anaesthesia and for the treatment of acute post-
operative pain. Recent research indicates thatActa Anaesthesiol Scand 2005; 49: 1405 —1428 Copyright #Acta Anaesthesiol Scand 2005

opioids produce not only analgesia, but also hyper-
algesia (5). Consequently, peri-operative (pre-, per-,
and post-operative) opioids may increase post-
operative pain and opioid requirements (6).
Central sensitization includes an altered processing
of innocuous, tactile impulses from myelinated
afferents so that activation of these fibres produces
painful sensations (7). The neurophysiological and
biochemical mechanisms of these alterations include
a decrease in inhibitory input or an increase in
synaptic efficacy or membrane excitability,
mediated by wind-up and neurokinin and
N-methyl- D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor mechan-
isms (7). Wind-up is a phenomenon whereby
responses of dorsal horn neurons increase during
repetitive, constant intensity, C-fibre stimuli, i.e.
increased duration and magnitude of the cell
responses. In animal studies, blockade of NMDA
receptors has been shown to prevent the develop-
ment of increased pain sensitivity and opioid toler-
ance (5, 8). Ketamine is a non-competitive NMDA
receptor antagonist. NMDA receptor blocking could
be a fruitful therapy for improving post-operative
opioid effectiveness. Ketamine could, in addition to
having an opioid-sparing effect, conceivably reduce
the development of chronic post-operative pain
through NMDA receptor blockade and reduction
of wind-up and central sensitization.
Published literature indicates that ketamine is used
in the peri-operative setting in countries such as
Greece, Brazil, India, Germany, UK, Israel, France,
China, Denmark, Norway, a nd Japan for anaesthesia
or as an adjuvant analgesic. However, current use of
ketamine in this setting involves different practice
regarding dose, route of administration and time of
administration. A literature review based on an elec-
tronic search of the MEDLINE database from 1966 to
1998 (1) concludes that the role of ketamine remains
controversial, but that low-dose ketamine (defined as
a bolus dose of less than 2 mg/kg when given intra-
muscularly or less than 1 mg/kg when administered
via the intravenous or epidural route) as an adjuvant
to opioids or local anaesthetics may have an impor-
tant role to play in the treatment of acute post-
operative pain. This review will consider the
evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of ketamine
in the treatment of acute post-operative pain in adults.
Methods
Search
To identify studies for inclusion in this review,
detailed search strategies were developed for eachelectronic database searched. These searches were
based on the search strategy developed for the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) and revised appropriately for each
database. The subject search used a combination of
controlled vocabulary and free text terms and was
performed in the Cochrane Pain, Palliative &
Supportive Care Register (current issue), the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library (June 2004),
MEDLINE (1966 to June 2004), EMBASE (1980 to
June 2004) and PARDLARS (Pfizer Corporation’s
in-house database) February 2003.
Reference lists of reports and reviews were also
searched. Abstracts and unpublished reports were
not considered. There was no language restriction.
Inclusion criteria
Randomized, placebo-controlled trials described as
double-blinded were included. Trials using active
controls in addition to placebo arms were also
included. Studies where ketamine was compared
with placebo or active control, and each group had
a minimum of 10 patients who had completed the
study, were included. All identified published trials
were considered eligible. Only complete studies, not
abstracts, were included. Duplicate publications are
reported but excluded from the analysis.
The population addressed by the review is
patients aged 18 years or above, undergoing a sur-
gical procedure.
The intervention considered by this review is
treatment with ketamine, given systemically or
spinally, in any dose during the peri-operative
period.
Data extraction and analysis
A data extraction form was designed and the fol-
lowing data items were collected: (i) publication
details, (ii) patient population, number of patients,
age, surgical procedure, (iii) description of interven-
tion, (iv) design, study duration and follow-up,
(v) outcome measures, (vi) analgesic outcome
results and (vii) withdrawals and adverse effects.
Study quality (randomization/allocation con-
cealment; details of blinding measures (9, 10); with-
drawals and dropouts; overall quality score) were
evaluated using the three-item (1—5) Oxford Quality
scale (11). Validity was evaluated using the five-item
(1—16) Oxford Pain Validity Scale (OPVS) (12).
Scoring was performed independently by two
reviewers (R.F.B., E.K.). In the case of discrepancy,
a third reviewer (J.B.D.) was consulted.R. F. Bell et al.

Both dichotomous and continuous data were
extracted. Heterogeneity tests were not used as
they have previously been shown to be unhelpful
(13, 14) although clinical homogeneity was exam-
ined visually (15). Meta-analysis was performed
where appropriate. The data did not permit calcula-
tion of odds ratios, numbers needed to treat (NNTs)
and numbers needed to harm (NNHs) with 95%
confidence intervals. Continuous data were ana-
lysed as weighted mean differences (WMD).
Subgroup analysis was not possible due to the
heterogeneity of the trials.
QUOROM guidelines for reporting meta-analyses
were followed (16).
Results
The searches identified a total of 165 possible titles.
Seventy-three were excluded. Eighteen were not clin-
ical trials. Thirty-eight were abstracts. Thirteen trials
did not concern post-operative pain. One was a retro-
spective study. One paper (1 7) was irretrievable. Two
were duplicates (18, 19). In addition, eight trials were
not randomized and 15 did not have an appropriate
control. Fourteen trials were not described as double-
blind. A total of 55 randomized, controlled, double-
blind clinical trials of peri-operative administration of
ketamine for post-operative pain control were identi-
fied. Eighteen trials were excluded: five due to the
administration form of ke tamine (two transdermal,
two intra-articular, one wound instillation). Four trials
were excluded because group s contained less than the
minimum of 10 patients who had completed the
study. Nine trials (20—28) were excluded due to meth-
odological flaws. The reasons for exclusion were as
follows: Clausen (20) (drugs randomized, not
patients/inappropriate pain scale); Heinke (21) (pri-
mary outcome PCA piritram ide consumption/fixed
maximum dose of piritramide); Joachimsson (22)
(inappropriate pain scale, patients on ventilator);
Reeves (23) (different PCA settings); Sadove (24) (inap-
propriate pain scale); Taura (25) (unclear blinding,
different doses of morphine); Weinbroum (26) (flawed
randomization); Wong (27) (a ll patients pre-treated
with ketamine); U ¨nlu¨genc (28) (different PCA
settings).
Thirty-seven trials (29—65) with 53 treatment arms
met the inclusion criteria. One study in Turkish (62)
was assessed with the help of a native speaker.
Description of studies
These 37 trials with 53 treatment arms could be
divided into:(a) 13 treatment arms with a pre-incisional intrave-
nous or intramuscular bolus of ketamine com-
pared with placebo;
(b) seven treatment arms with an intravenous-bolus of
ketamine at wound closure compared with
placebo;
(c) 13 treatment arms with a peri-operative continu-
ous infusion/repeated boluses of intravenous keta-
mine compared with placebo;
(d) seven treatment arms with administration of a pre-
incisional bolus of epidural ketamine;
(e) three treatment arms with administration of a post-
incisional bolus of epidural ketamine;
(f) two treatment arms with administration of a con-
tinuous peri-operative epidural infusion of keta-
mine compared with placebo;
(g) two treatment arms with intra-operative intravenous
ketamine vs. placebo combined with post-operative
PCA ketamine/morphine vs. PCA morphine;
(h) four treatment arms with post-operative intrave-
nous PCA ketamine/morphine, compared with
intravenous PCA morphine; and
(i) two treatment arms with patient-controlled
epidural analgesia (PCEA) ketamine þmorphine
(and other drugs), compared with PCEA morphine
(and other drugs).
Twenty-six trials had a placebo control while 11
used morphine as a control. A total of 2137 patients,
of which 1210 received ketamine, were studied. Pain
was rated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) in 34
trials, and using a verbal rating scale (VRS) in three.
The most common route of administration of keta-
mine was intravenous, as a bolus and/or infusion.
In six trials, ketamine was administered as an epi-
dural bolus. PCA ketamine was used in four studies
and PCEA ketamine in two. Thirty-two trials used
racemic ketamine, four trials used S( þ) ketamine
and one trial used the R(—) isomer.
Quality and validity scores were generally high
with a mean quality score of 3.9 and a mean validity
score of 10.3. Three trials were considered non-sen-
sitive (41, 50, 53, see Tables 1,3,8). Sensitivity was
judged according to criteria in the OPVS.

Twelve trials with 13 treatment arms compared a
pre-incisional bolus dose of ketamine with placebo
(Table 1). R(—) ketamine was used in one treatment
arm (50), S( þ) ketamine in one treatment arm (32)
and racemic ketamine in 11 treatment arms.Peri-operative ketamine for acute post-operative pain

The retrieved trials were heterogeneous. The doses
of ketamine varied almost sevenfold, from 0.15 to
1.0 mg/kg intravenously. Different analgesics and
treatment regimens were employed for rescue medi-
cation, and the surgical procedures included various
gynaecological, abdominal, and orthopaedic opera-
tions. Due to this disparity, a meta-analysis of the
combined results was not considered rational.
In one of these trials having two treatment arms,
one pre- and one post-incisional, all patients had been
pre-treated with intramuscular ketorolac together
with pre-incisional skin infiltration with bupivacaine
(50). This trial was scored as non-sensitive.
Post-operative analgesic requirements were reduced
by a pre-incisional ketamine bolus in eight out of 13
treatment arms. VAS pain scores were reduced for up
to 24 h post-operatively in seven of the 13 arms.
(b) Studies with administration of an intravenous-bolus of
ketamine at wound closure compared with placebo [seven
treatment arms, n (ketamine treated) ¼212]
Five trials with seven treatment arms compared a
post-incisional bolus dose of ketamine with placebo
(Table 2). R(—) ketamine was used in one (50) and
racemic ketamine in six treatment arms.
Again the trials were heterogenous and involved
such different surgical procedures as elective out-
patient surgery and abdominal hysterectomy.
Ketamine doses ranged from 0.05 to 1 mg/kg. Two
studies (50, 51) used PCA opioid for post-operative
pain and three studies used an incremental intrave-
nous-opioid bolus on request.
In three out of seven treatment arms, post-opera-
tive morphine requirements were reduced by post-
incisional ketamine. VAS pain scores were reduced
in four out of seven treatment arms.
(c) Studies with administration of a peri-operative
continuous infusion/repeated boluses of intravenous-
ketamine compared with placebo [13 treatment arms, n
(ketamine treated) ¼290]
Eleven trials with 13 treatment arms compared a
peri-operative continuous intravenous infusion/
repeated intravenous bolus of ketamine with pla-
cebo (Table 3). A ketamine infusion was used in 12
treatment arms and a repeated intra-operative bolus
of ketamine at 20-min intervals in one (32). S( þ)
ketamine was used in two treatment arms (32, 42)
and racemic ketamine in 11.
The surgical procedures varied and included pre-
dominantly major abdominal and renal surgery.
There was clinical heterogeneity, with widevariation in the total ketamine dose administered
due to different doses and duration of infusions.
Different analgesics and treatment regimens were
employed for rescue medication.
In one treatment arm, all patients received epi-
dural bupivacaine 2.5 mg/ml, 4 ml/h for 0—24 h
post-operatively (41). This was a trial with a nega-
tive outcome and was considered potentially non-
sensitive. However, as the patients experienced pain
above 30 on the VAS during movement in the early
post-operative period, and to avoid bias, the trial
was included in the quantitative analysis.
Ketamine treatment reduced post-operative
analgesic requirements in nine out of 13 treatment
arms. VAS pain scores were reduced in seven out of
13 treatment arms.
(d) Studies with administration of a pre-incisional bolus of
epidural ketamine [eight treatment arms, n (ketamine
treated) ¼119]
Seven trials with seven treatment arms investigated
a pre-incisional epidural bolus of ketamine
(Table 4). Two trials with two treatment arms inves-
tigated a pre-incisional epidural bolus of ketamine
and morphine compared with morphine alone.
Racemic ketamine was used in six treatment arms,
while S( þ) ketamine was used in one (40). These
trials concerned major surgical procedures such as
total abdominal hysterectomy, colectomy, gastrect-
omy and total knee arthroplasty. The ketamine
doses varied from 0.25 to 1 mg/kg.
Consumption of rescue analgesics was reduced in
only two out of seven treatment arms.
Pain scores were reduced in three out of seven
treatment arms. One trial did not provide pain
score data (59).
(e) Studies with administration of a post-incisional bolus of
epidural ketamine [three treatment arms, n (ketamine
treated) ¼61]
Three trials with three treatment arms investigated a
post-incisional epidural bolus of ketamine (Table 5)
Two trials investigated epidural ketamine þ
morphine, compared with epidural morphine
alone (56, 60). One trial compared epidural keta-
mine with placebo (29). All trials used racemic keta-
mine. Two trials used a ketamine dose of 30 mg
while the third trial used a dose of 1 mg/kg.
Analgesic consumption was reduced in two out of
three treatment arms. Two treatment arms found no
difference in pain scores. The third trial (60) did not
provide pain score data.R. F. Bell et al.

(f) Studies with administration of a continuous peri-
operative epidural infusion of ketamine compared with
placebo [two treatment arms, n (ketamine treated) ¼40]
One trial with two treatment arms (36) investigated an
epidural bolus of ketamine followed by an epidural
infusion of ketamine until the end of surgery, com-
pared with a control group (no ketamine) (Table 6).
This trial used racemic ketamine at a dose of
0.25 mg/kg bolus þ0.125 mg/kg/h in one treatment
arm and 0.5 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg/h in the other.
There was no significant difference in post-
operative analgesic consumption or pain scores.
(g) Studies with intra-operative intravenous ketamine vs.
placebo combined with post-operative PCA ketamine/
morphine vs. PCA morphine [two treatment arms, n
(ketamine treated) ¼37]
Two trials with two treatment arms investigated
intra-operative intravenous ketamine combined
with post-operative PCA ketamine þmorphine,
compared with per-operative placebo and post-
operative PCA morphine (Table 7). S( þ) ketamine
was used in one trial (57) and racemic ketamine in
the other (38).
Cumulative morphine consumption and pain
scores at rest were reduced in one treatment arm (57).
(h) Studies with post-operative intravenous PCA ketamine/
morphine, compared with intravenous PCA morphine [four
treatment arms, n (ketamine treated) ¼110]
Four trials with four treatment arms investigated
post-operative intravenous PCA ketamine þ
morphine, compared with intravenous PCA mor-
phine (Table 8). Racemic ketamine was used in
all trials. Doses ranged from 0.75 to 2 mg/ml. One
trial was judged to be potentially non-sensitive as
60—70% of the patients were pain free for the first
4 h after surgery (53).
Morphine consumption was reduced in two out of
four treatment arms. Pain scores were reduced in
three out of four treatment arms.
(i) Studies with PCEA ketamine þmorphine (and other
drugs), compared with PCEA morphine (and other drugs)
[two treatment arms, n (ketamine treated) ¼75]
Two trials with two treatment arms investigated
PCEA ketamine þmorphine, compared with
PCEA morphine (Table 9). These studies were per-
formed in patients undergoing major thoracic or
abdominal surgery. Racemic ketamine was used in
both treatment arms.Table 2 Continued

requirements or pain intensity, or both.
Ketamine dose
The question of optimal ketamine dose is not
resolved by these heterogenous trials. Out of inter-
est, we wanted to see whether there was a dose-
dependent effect. Using an ‘average’ weight of
70 kg, we roughly calculated the mean 24-h dose
of ketamine for each of the trials included in the
24-h PCA morphine meta-analysis. The trials could
be divided into four groups: one group with an
estimated dose of approximately 10 mg, one group
with estimated dose of approximately 30 mg, a third
group with estimated dose of approximately 65 mg
and a fourth group with estimated dose of 250—270 mg.
Interestingly, there seemed to be no increased
morphine-sparing effect on increasing the ketamine
dose above an estimated dose of 30 mg/24 h.
Adverse effects
Two trials (31, 62) did not report on adverse effects.
In general, the occurrence of adverse effects was
similar in ketamine- and placebo-treated groups.
Psychotomimetic adverse effects
Twenty-one of 37 trials specifically stated that there
were no psychotomimetic adverse effects such as
hallucinations, bad dreams or dysphoria.
Psychotomimetic adverse effects were reported in
four trials (33, 41, 43, 60). Ilkjær et al. (41) reported
that two patients in the ketamine group, and one in
the placebo group, experienced psychomimetic
side-effects. Burstal et al. (33) reported withdrawal
of four patients in the ketamine group due to dys-
phoria. Subramaniam et al. (60) reported one patient
developing hallucinations after pre-operative
administration of ketamine, but no psychotomimeticTable 4 Continued

experiencing dysphoria, compared with three in
the control group.
Nausea and vomiting
One trial reported significantly less nausea in the
ketamine-treated group compared with placebo
(30). One trial reported significantly less nausea in
the ketamine þmorphine-treated group, compared
with the morphine group (43). One trial reported
significantly less nausea, vomiting and use of antie-

Four trials (37, 41, 50, 59) reported increased seda-

reported significantly higher sedation scores for 0

higher sedation scores for the first 15 min after extu-

treated group opened their eyes significantly faster
and were extubated earlier than the R(—) ketamine-

high sedation scores in six patients in the ketamine
group, compared with none in the control group, for
the first 2 h after surgery, but no difference
thereafter.

Diplopia as an adverse effect of ketamine was
reported in three trials (30, 42, 45). Adriaenssens
(30) reported that two out of 15 ketamine-treated
patients experienced diplopia, while Jaksch (42)
reported diplopia in one out of 15 patients in the

vided the necessary data. Though the author of one
trial (55) could not be contacted, data could be
extracted from a figure. In two trials (36, 53) it was
not possible to obtain the requested data.
In a total of 10 trials with 11 treatment arms and a
total of 432 patients, treatment with ketamine sig-
nificantly reduced PCA morphine consumption in
the first 24 h after surgery [WMD /C015.98 mg with
95% CI ( /C019.70,/C012.26)] (Fig. 1).
Meta-analysis of adverse effects with ketamine
Twenty-six out of 37 trials provided dichotomous
data on nausea and vomiting, or nausea and/or
vomiting. The total number of patients in the com-
parison was 1261. When all data were combined,
treatment with ketamine significantly reduced
post-operative nausea and vomiting ( P¼0.001).
When the data for nausea and for vomiting alone
were analysed, treatment with ketamine reduced
nausea ( P¼0.03) and vomiting ( P¼0.002). When
the data from trials included in the 24-h PCA mor-
phine consumption analysis were examined sepa-
rately, ketamine reduced nausea and vomiting
(P¼0.03) (Fig. 2).
Discussion
The objective of this systematic review was to assess
the effectiveness and adverse effects of peri-
operative ketamine in the treatment of acute post-
operative pain.
Twenty-seven out of 37 trials found that peri-
operative ketamine reduced rescue analgesic
requirements or pain intensity, or both. Ten trials
found no significant difference between ketamine
and placebo, three of which were considered non-
sensitive.
During the preparation of this review, two sys-
tematic reviews investigating ketamine for post-
operative pain were published (66, 67). These
reviews include trials in children and trials
excluded in our own review due to route of admin-
istration and/or methodological issues. The authors
of the first review (66) included 37 trials. The pri-
mary outcome was VAS scores in the first 24 h after
surgery. Due to the heterogeneity of the data, we
have chosen to restrict quantitative analysis to 24-h
PCA morphine consumption and data on PONV.
The second review (67) has similar findings to our
own, with ketamine giving a clear decrease in 24-h
cumulative morphine consumption with a weightedTable 6

mean difference of /C015.7 mg. This review, including
studies performed in children and adults, is
restricted to randomized comparisons of ketamine
with inactive controls.
Ten trials with 11 treatment arms and 417 patients in
the comparison provided extractable data on 24-h
PCA morphine consumption. When these data were
combined, ketamine was shown to be effective in
reducing post-operative morphine requirements. This
should be interpreted with caution, as the number of
patients is small, and doses and time of administration
differ widely between trials. Performing separate
meta-analysis on data from the separate treatment
arms was considered but decided against, as the data
were heterogenous and the number of patients in each
analysis would be very small. The meta-analysis gave
aW M Do f /C015.98 mg. The clinical relevance of this
dose reduction in the first 24 h after surgery may be
debated. When individual trial data were examined,
including trials that were not included in the quanti-
tative analysis, ketamine was generally reported to
give a 30—50% reduction of rescue analgesics. A reduc-
tion of this order may well be clinically significant,
especially in selected patient groups. Peri-operative
ketamine may be useful for patients who traditionally
require larger doses of opioids, such as cancer patients
on long-term opioid therapy or the drug-dependent
patient population. Patients who are especially sensi-
tive to the adverse effects of opioids, such as the
elderly, may also be a target group for this treatment.
Randomized, placebo contro lled trials in these patient
groups would be clinically relevant.
Elia et al. (67) found that ketamine treatment did
not reduce morphine-related adverse effects. They
also found that the highest risk of hallucinations
was in awake or sedated patients receiving keta-
mine without benzodiazepine, and that in patients
undergoing general anaesthesia, the risk of halluci-
nations was low and independent of benzodiaze-
pine premedication. In our own review where
surgery was performed under general anesthesia
in 35 out of the 37 included trials, ketamine-related
adverse effects were mild or absent. Elia et al. ana-
lysing data from 391 patients treated with ketamine
and 284 patients receiving inactive control, found no
decrease in PONV. In contrast, our analysis of data
from 705 patients treated with ketamine and 578
patients receiving active or inactive control, showed
a significant reduction of nausea and vomiting in
ketamine-treated patients.
Issues of optimal dose and form of administration
are not resolved by the current data. The most com-
mon route of administration for ketamine wasTable 9

intravenous bolus and/or infusion, while 10 studies
investigated epidural ketamine. Spinal ketamine is
not a recommended route of administration due to
unclear toxicity issues (1). Whether the isomers S( þ)
or R(—) ketamine have advantages over the racemate
is not clear from the current data.
Three studies (41, 50, 53) were considered to be non-
sensitive. The issue of study sensitivity in trial design
is important. In general, sensitivity measures cannot
be used for studies with PCA analgesic consumption
as an endpoint (68). However, there are a number of
factors which may decrease study sensitivity and
which should be considered when designing clinical
trials on post-operative pain. In one trial, all patients
received a constant infusion of bupivacaine post-
operatively (41), while in another, all patients received
pre-treatment with ketorolac and pre-incisional skin
infiltration with bupivacaine (50). These factors may
have been responsible for low levels of pain. These
studies could produce false/negative results as they
would be unable to detect a difference between keta-
mine and placebo had there been one.
Only one study (36) included long-term follow-up
regarding mechanical hyperalgesia and residual pain.
An important question, which has not been addressed
in the current literature, is whether ketamine prevents
the development of hyperalgesia during surgery and/
or the development of chronic post-surgical pain.
NMDA receptor antagonists, including ketamine, have
been shown to prevent the development of hyperalgesia
(69, 70). Chronic post-surgical pain is more common
than previously thought (71—74). Certain types of sur-
gical intervention, for example thoracotomy and mas-
tectomy, have a relatively high prevalence of chronic
post-surgical pain. Studies with long-term follow-up in
these patient groups would therefore be of interest.
Ketamine is a readily available, inexpensive drug.
It is generally thought that it has limited usefulness
in pain management due to adverse effects. This is
not supported by the current evidence in relation to
acute post-operative pain in adults where adverse
effects were mild or absent. In fact, ketamine
reduces post-operative nausea and vomiting.
Because both ketamine and morphine are reported
to cause nausea and vomiting, it is interesting that a
combination of morphine and ketamine appears to
reduce PONV. When low-dose ketamine is given to
healthy volunteers, the incidence of nausea and
vomiting appears to be greater than that reported
in the clinical setting (1). The observed reduction in
PONV in the studies included in this review may be
due to a morphine-sparing effect or to other as yet
undetermined factors. Not all trials providedReview: Peri-operative ketamine for acute post-operative pain

extractable data regarding nausea and vomiting. It
is recommended that future trials report adverse
effects as dichotomous data.
The large number of papers retrieved shows that
there is considerable interest in the use of ketamine
for acute post-operative pain. A number of studies are
only published as abstracts. It will be interesting to see
whether they are ultimately published, and how the
new data will contribute to current findings.
Conclusions
Ketamine is effective in reducing morphine require-
ments in the first 24 h after surgery. Adverse effects
are mild or absent. Ketamine reduces post-operative
nausea and vomiting. These data should be inter-
preted with caution as the retrieved studies were
heterogenous and the result of the meta-analysis
can not be translated into any specific administra-
tion regimen with ketamine.
Future trials should focus on optimal dose and have
long-term follow-up with regard to the development
of hyperalgesia and chronic post-surgical pain. Trials
of peri-operative ketamine in selected patient groups
where opioid sparing is desirable would be of inter-
est. Better reporting of adverse effects, for example as
dichotomous data, is required.
