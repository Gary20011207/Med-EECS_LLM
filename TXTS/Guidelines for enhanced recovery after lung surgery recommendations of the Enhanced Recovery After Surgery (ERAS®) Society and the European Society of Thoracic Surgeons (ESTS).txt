Abstract
Enhanced recovery after surgery is well established in specialties such as colorectal surgery. It is achieved through the introduction of mul-
tiple evidence-based perioperative measures that aim to diminish postoperative organ dysfunction while facilitating recovery. This review
aims to present consensus recommendations for the optimal perioperative management of patients undergoing thoracic surgery (princi-
pally lung resection). A systematic review of meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, large non-randomized studies and reviews was
conducted for each protocol element. Smaller prospective and retrospective cohort studies were considered only when higher-level evi-
dence was unavailable. The quality of the evidence base was graded by the authors and used to form consensus recommendations for
each topic. Development of these recommendations was endorsed by the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery Society and the European
Society for Thoracic Surgery. Recommendations were developed for a total of 45 enhanced recovery items covering topics related to pre-
admission, admission, intraoperative care and postoperative care. Most are based on good-quality studies. In some instances, good-
                                                                                                                                Downloaded  from https://academic.oup.com/ejcts/article/55/1/91/5124324 by National Taiwan University user on 28 April 2025
quality data were not available, and subsequent recommendations are generic or based on data extrapolated from other specialties. In
other cases, no recommendation can currently be made because either equipoise exists or there is a lack of available evidence.
Recommendations are based not only on the quality of the evidence but also on the balance between desirable and undesirable effects.
Key recommendations include preoperative counselling, nutritional screening, smoking cessation, prehabilitation for high-risk patients,
avoidance of fasting, carbohydrate loading, avoidance of preoperative sedatives, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, prevention of
hypothermia, short-acting anaesthetics to facilitate early emergence, regional anaesthesia, nausea and vomiting control, opioid-sparing
analgesia, euvolemic ﬂuid management, minimally invasive surgery, early chest drain removal, avoidance of urinary catheters and early
mobilization after surgery. These guidelines outline recommendations for the perioperative management of patients undergoing lung sur-
gery based on the best available evidence. As the recommendation grade for most of the elements is strong, the use of a systematic peri-
operative care pathway has the potential to improve outcomes after surgery.
