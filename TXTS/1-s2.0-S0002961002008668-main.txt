Abstract
Objective: Toevaluatetheeffectofmodifyingperioperativecareinnoncardiacsurgicalpatientsonmorbidity,mortality,andotheroutcome
measures.Background: New approaches in pain control, introduction of techniques that reduce the perioperative stress response, and the more
frequent use of minimal invasive surgical access have been introduced over the past decade. The impact of these interventions, either aloneor in combination, on perioperative outcome was evaluated.Methods: We searched Medline for the period of 1980 to the present using the key terms fast track surgery, accelerated care programs,
postoperativecomplicationsandpreoperativepatientpreparation;andweexaminedanddiscussedthearticlesthatwereidentiﬁedtoincludein this review. This information was supplemented with our own research on the mediators of the stress response in surgical patients, theuse of epidural anesthesia in elective operations, and pilot studies of fast track surgical procedures using the multimodality approach.Results: The introduction of newer approaches to perioperative care has reduced both morbidity and mortality in surgical patients. In the
future, most elective operations will become day surgical procedures or require only 1 to 2 days of postoperative hospitalization.Reorganizationoftheperioperativeteam(anesthesiologists,surgeons,nurses,andphysicaltherapists)willbeessentialtoachievesuccessfulfast track surgical programs.Conclusions: Understanding perioperative pathophysiology and implementation of care regimes to reduce the stress of an operation, will
continue to accelerate rehabilitation associated with decreased hospitalization and increased satisfaction and safety after discharge.Developments and improvements of multimodal interventions within the context of “fast track” surgery programs represents the majorchallenge for the medical professionals working to achieve a “pain and risk free” perioperative course. © 2002 Excerpta Medica, Inc.

Surgicalproceduresdominatethecareprovidedbyhospitals
and care centers located within the United States. In 1996,more than one half of the 71,900,000 procedures performedin this country were carried out in hospitalized patients [1].While many of these diagnostic and therapeutic modalitieswere performed on acutely ill individuals who requiredhospitalization, a large proportion (at least 30%) were elec-tive or semielective operations that subsequently resulted inpatients remaining in the hospital for postoperative care.
Traditionally, patients have remained hospitalized after
an operation in order to be observed and treated for anyanesthetic or surgical complications that may arise. In ad-dition, patients are nursed back to a level of self care before
discharge. With advances in anesthetic and perioperativecare and improvements in surgical technique (such as min-imally invasive operations) the requirements for postopera-tive hospitalization have decreased. However, even withearlier discharge, patients may experience debility for sev-eral weeks or months after an operation.
Attention is now being directed toward standardizing
surgical care, evaluating new therapies to be used in theperioperative period, and applying a combination of tech-niquestoreducecomplications,shortenconvalescentrecov-ery, and decrease the use of hospital resources.
This paper reviews the more contemporary evidence that
relates methods of perioperative care in noncardiac surgerywith shortened hospitalization and improved outcome afteran elective or semi-elective operation.

Areas for potential improvement: preoperative period
Prospective assessment of the severity of concomitant
organ dysfunction is routine practice during preoperativeevaluations,andappropriatecaremapsorrecommendationsare available for patients with cardiac disease [2], chronicobstructive lung disease [3], diabetes mellitus [4], and otherdisorders [5]. Such preoperative evaluation and optimiza-tion of organ dysfunction should be instituted in all patientsto reduce morbidity and mortality.
Recent studies have shown that individuals who abuse
alcohol, even in the absence of overt alcohol-related organdysfunction, are subject to higher morbidity and prolongedrecoveryafteranoperationthannonabusers[6].Subsequentintervention that included preoperative alcohol abstinencefor 4 weeks reduced the increased morbidity after colonicsurgery compared with patients who continued their drink-ing habits [7]. Smoking also represents a surgical risk [8].Evaluating lung macrophage activity in patients and recentstudies have demonstrated that smoking is associated with amarked reduction in phagocytic and microbicidal activity,possibly related to reduced proin ﬂammatory cytokine activ-
ity [9]. However, no recent controlled studies have beenperformed to evaluate the role of preoperative smokingcessation on outcome. Efforts should be made to reducesmoking in abusers using newer modalities to aid cessationas 1 to 2 months of abstinence is required to improvepulmonary function in nonsurgical studies [10].
Preoperative nutritional support of 7 to 10 days duration
is only effective in reducing complications in the moreseverelymalnourishedpatients(morethan15%weightloss)[11]. However, other patient groups, such as those withCrohn’s disease [12] and the elderly [13], have been found
to manifest signi ﬁcant micronutrient de ﬁciencies or ingest
levels of vitamins and minerals below recommended allow-ances. Evaluation and preoperative micronutrient supple-mentation may be bene ﬁcial in these selected patient
groups.
Practice guidelines for preoperative fasting usually rec-
ommend a 2- to 6-hour period of nothing-by-mouth beforeoperation. Recent clinical studies have shown that preoper-ative intake of a carbohydrate drink may reduce the post-operativeendocrinecatabolicresponsesandimproveinsulinresistance [14]. Investigators have hypothesized that thisapproachmayimproveoutcome.Furtheref ﬁcacyandsafety
studies are needed, however, before routine preoperativeoral glucose containing drinks can be recommended.
Patient education of the postoperative care plan plays a
major role in modifying the individual ’s response to the
operative experience. Classic studies have demonstratedthat the knowledgeable patient requires less analgesia in the
postoperative period and at the same time, experiences sig-niﬁcantly less pain than the less informed patient [15], and
more recent investigations have supported the conclusionthat preoperative information will aid coping, reduce pre-operativeanxiety,andmayalsoenhancepostsurgicalrecov-
ery [16,17].
Operative period
Prophylactic antibiotics
Treatment immediately before the operation with a cor-
rect dose of the appropriate antibiotic is uniformly recom-mended for almost all operations [18]. Addition antibioticsmay be indicated postoperatively with the insertion of pros-thetic materials [19,20]. Timing of antibiotic administrationis extremely important; intravenous infusion should occurapproximately 30 minutes before the initial skin incision,thus insuring that peak tissue concentrations are achieved atthe time of operation.
The tissue concentrations will generally be sustained
over one half-life of the drug, and for most operations, onlya single preoperative dose of drug is necessary [18]. Forlonger procedures not involving a prosthesis, a second dosemay be indicated, but prolonged administration of postop-erative antibiotics has not been associated with reducedwound infections. For colon operations, oral antibiotics arefrequently used but the need for prolonged mechanicalcleaning and oral antibiotics is debatable [21].
Supplemental oxygen has also been associated with a
decreased infection rate [22], and the positive bene ﬁts of
using this approach in the perioperative period will bereviewed later.
Use of regional anesthesia
Choice of anesthetic technique may depend on the type
of surgery, preexisting disease, and effects of the agentsutilizedonintraoperativeandpostoperativeorganfunctions.Ideally, an anesthetic technique should have extended ef-fects on analgesia and stress-induced organ dysfunctionsover the postoperative period. Regional anesthesia repre-sents the only anesthetic technique available to date thatfulﬁlls these criteria, and regional anesthetic techniques
utilizing local anesthetics are the most powerful therapyavailable to attenuate the endocrine-metabolic responses(the rise in cortisol, catecholamines, glucagon; hyperglyce-mia; insulin resistance and negative nitrogen balance) [23,24]. This effect is most pronounced when utilized withprocedures performed on the lower body where spinal orepidural anesthesia may provide a near total afferent neuralblockade.
In contrast, there is a smaller inhibitory effect with tho-
racic epidural anesthetic techniques for operations per-formed in the upper abdomen [24].
The inhibitory effects on catabolic responses are most
pronounced when regional anesthesia is provided for up to24to48hours,preferablyasacontinuousepiduralanalgesictechnique [24]. In contrast to endocrine-metabolic re-

sponses, the in ﬂammatory responses (alterations in concen-
trations of acute phase proteins, IL-6, and other cellularimmune functions) are not modi ﬁed by neural blockade
techniques [23,24]. However, as a consequence of the re-duced stress response and inhibition of autonomic re ﬂexes
that occur after an operation, postoperative organ dysfunc-tions may be attenuated (Fig. 1). This includes reducedimpairment in pulmonary function [23,25] and decreasedcardiac demands [23,26]. In addition, the ileus that accom-panies intraabdominal procedures may be shortened by sev-eraldaysusingcontinuous thoracicepidurallocalanesthetic
with or without small doses or opioids. This effect has notbeen observed after lumbarepidural local anesthesia or
epidural opioid analgesia [23,24,27,28].
Spinal or epidural anesthetic techniques may not be the
ﬁrst choice for many operations. For example, the intraop-
erative use of local in ﬁltration anesthesia for hernia surgery
providedastress-freeoperationandallowedearlydischargewith minimal side effects [29,30]. Furthermore, urinaryretentionwaseliminatedandtherewasapronouncedreduc-tion in cost. Similar results have been reported with the useof paravertebral blockade for operations on the breast [31]and with other peripheral nerve block techniques in a vari-ety of procedures.
The use of central blockade techniques (spinal or epi-
dural anesthesia) with or without additional general anes-thesia has recently been analyzed by comparing all random-ized trials with outcome from general anesthesia alone [32].This meta-analysis demonstrates signi ﬁcant reduction in
postoperative mortality and the rate of myocardial infarc-tion, pneumonia, thromboembolic complications, acute re-nal failure, and bleeding and transfusion requirements (Ta-ble1).Nodifferenceshavebeendemonstratedinpostoperative
cerebral dysfunction between regional and general anesthe-sia [25,32], but none of the existing studies have alteredother aspects of perioperative care, such as reducing the useof opioid and benzodiazepines and treating hypoxemia, fac-tors that may contribute to postoperative cerebral dysfunc-tion.
The value of continuous epidural local anesthetic tech-
niques in patients after procedures in the upper abdomenand thorax has been debated [23 –25] although a recent
meta-analysis including lower body procedures demon-strated a signi ﬁcant reduction of pulmonary complicata-
tions, compared with other analgesic techniques (intercostalblock, epidural or systemic opioid techniques) [25]. How-ever, previous studies on continuous epidural analgesiahave not included changes in perioperative care that incor-porate earlier rehabilitation with feeding, mobilization,physiotherapy, and other approaches to be discussed later.
Minimally invasive surgery
The use of endoscopic procedures has revolutionized
several aspects of surgical care and has caused major re-evaluationoftraditionalcareregimenswhencomparedwithopen procedures. The use of minimal invasive abdominalsurgical techniques has not resulted in a signi ﬁcant reduc-
tion of the classical endocrine metabolic responses, but hasreduced various in ﬂammatory responses (acute phase pro-
teins,leukocytosis,IL-6,andsoforth)andimmunodysfunc-tions [33]. Pulmonary function has improved with less hy-poxemia compared with open surgery, although differencesbetween laparoscopic and “minicholecystectomy ”are less
apparent [33]. Postoperative paralytic ileus has been re-duced in experimental and clinical studies [28]. Subse-quently most studies have reported less pain, shorter hospi-tal stay, and reduction of morbidity after laparoscopicsurgery.
When compared with other approaches, the question
remains, however, whether this is a result of altered patho-

physiological (in ﬂammatory) responses to the operation or
whether this is due to concomitant changes in postoperativecare due to the expected faster recovery from laparoscopicsurgery. A critical view of randomized trials comparing“open”and laparoscopic procedures indicates that tradi-
tional care regimens have rarely been revised in the opentreatment groups, but have been modi ﬁed in the laparas-
copic group, thereby favoring the expected improved out-come after minimally invasive surgery. Several studies inwhich hospital stay and convalescence were utilized asendpointsmaymerelyre ﬂecttraditionsofperioperativecare
associated with open procedures rather than differencesbetween open and closed surgical techniques [33]. Thus,“fast track”surgery with minimal hospital stay and reduced
convalescence has been reported in laparoscopic cholecys-tectomy, hernorrhaphy, and colonic resection. However, thesameresultswereachievedafterbothopenandlaparoscopicprocedureswhentheperioperativecareregimenswerestan-dardized (see below).
Minimally invasive procedures will continue to be per-
formed but the physiological and biochemical impact ofthese operations on outcome can only be evaluated if pa-tients after both open and laparoscopic procedures are af-forded a similar postoperative rehabilitation program de-signed to optimize recovery. Nevertheless, minimalinvasive surgery remains one of the most important tech-niques for future improvement of postoperative outcome.
Intraoperative normothermia
During operations, patients are frequently subjected to
cold stress, as operative rooms are maintained between 20 °
and 25°C, temperatures that are generally just below the
zone of thermal neutrality for semiclad patients [34]. Inaddition, the administration of general anesthesia alters theregulatory setpoint for defense against cold exposure, thusrendering the patient poikilothermic [35]. That is, the pa-tient’s core temperature (usually 37 °C) is now determined
by the external environment, and hypothermia is frequentlyobserved, particularly with moderate to prolonged proce-dures (longer than 2 hours). Both spinal and epidural anes-thetics also alter central and peripheral thermoregulatoryresponses, and mild hypothermia (a reduction of 1 °to 3°in
core temperature) is frequently observed in patients receiv-ing these types of regional anesthetics [35].
After operations such as aortic aneurysectomy, colec-
tomy,orlowerextremityjointreplacement,itisnotunusualfor patients to demonstrate a falling core temperature of 2 °
to 4°C. This decline in central temperature stimulates the
outpouringofcortisolandcatecholaminesandaugmentsthestress response to the surgical procedure [36]. When com-pared with normothermic controls, this degree of mild hy-pothermia has been associated with a twofold to threefoldincrease in surgical wound infections [37]. In addition,hypothermia has been related to a signi ﬁcant increase of
intraoperative blood loss, in most [38 –40] but not all stud-ies [41], an increased incidence of operative and postoper-
ative cardiac events, including postoperative ventriculartachycardia [42,43], a 40% increase in postoperative nitro-gen excretion [44], and an increase in patient discomfort[43]. Active prevention of intraoperative hypothermia byutilizing specially constructed forced air heaters placed onthe operative table is recommended in major surgical pro-cedures to facilitate recovery.
Postoperative care
Revising perioperative care regimens
Guidelines for perioperative care should be developed
based upon scienti ﬁc data. However, many postoperative
practices have evolved from traditions that perpetuate theuse of drains, tubes, catheters, and restrictions for oralintake and mobilization. These approaches have been asso-ciated in the past with a successful outcome but in light ofcontemporary practice may reduce recovery or even con-tribute to morbidity. The routineuse of nasogastric tubes
after elective abdominal surgery is unnecessary and maycontribute to pulmonary complications, based upon a meta-analysis of several controlled trials [45]. The routine use ofdrains in cholecystectomy [46], joint replacement [47 –49],
colonic surgery [50,51], radical hysterectomy or lymphad-enectomy [52,53], and thyroid surgery [54] does not im-prove outcome as determined by randomized clinical stud-ies. Thus, routine drainage may be avoided in most cases orlimited to a short period, to facilitate early mobilization.However, after mastectomy, postoperative drainage mayreduce seroma formation and other wound problems [55 –
57]. Postoperative wound drainage after mastectomy maynot limit discharge, as it can be managed on an outpatientbasis.
The use of postoperative urinary bladder drainage has
becomeroutineaftermajoroperations.Fewcontrolledstud-ies are available to de ﬁne the optimal duration of such
drainage, but after major low-rectal operations, urinarybladder drainage should be limited to about 3 days and to 1day after other types of colonic surgery [58,59]. The use oflow-dose thoracic epidural bupivacaine-opioid administra-tionforpostoperativepainreliefshouldnotbeanindicationfor bladder drainage beyond 24 hours, despite continuousepidural treatment [59].
Traditional postoperative care often includes bed rest,
which is undesirable because it increases muscle loss andweakness, impairs pulmonary function and tissue oxygen-ation, and predisposes to thromboembolic and pulmonarycomplications and orthostatic intolerance [60]. All effortsshould be made to enforce postoperative mobilization,which is possible with effective pain relief.
Oral intake is frequently limited in the postoperative
period. When enteral feedings are provided, they are oftengivenasadietprogressionfromliquidstosofttosolidfood;
633 H. Kehlet and D.W. Wilmore / The American Journal of Surgery 183 (2002) 630 –641
there is no scienti ﬁc basis for such practice. In fact, several
studies have shown that early oral feedings are safe evenafter colonic surgery with bowel anastomoses [61 –63]. If
nausea, vomiting, or ileus are present, effective pharmaco-logical treatment should be utilized and feeding should beinitiated.
Thromboembolic prophylaxis
Surgical injury changes the coagulatory/ ﬁbrinolytic bal-
ance in favor of coagulation, thereby increasing the risk ofdeep venous and pulmonary thromboembolism. Guidelinesfor prevention of venous thromboembolism have thereforebeendevelopedbaseduponnumerousrandomizedtrialsandmeta-analyses [64]. However, such guidelines have rarelyconsidered the role of anesthetic-analgesic techniques inprophylaxis. A recent meta-analysis [32] and review [65]have emphasized the important role of epidural analgesia toreduce deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolismeven in high-risk patients undergoing major joint replace-ments. Preliminary observations suggest that combinedtreatment with epidural analgesia and chemoprophylaxismay further reduce thromboembolism [65]. Unfortunately,in the United States low molecular-weight heparin has beenadministered at a higher dose than given in Europe, result-ing in an apparent higher risk of epidural hematoma. Thecombined use of neuraxial block and standard heparinthromboembolic phrophylaxis does not carry increased risk[66], but combined use of neuraxial block and low molec-ular-weight heparin with doses recommended in the UnitedStatesrequiremorestudy,withdosesadjusteddownwardtomeet revised practice guidelines [67].
The use of intermittent pneumatic compression is wide-
spread owing to the documented ef ﬁcacy [64] and avoid-
ance of potential hemorrhagic complications. However,pneumatic compression devices may limit early mobiliza-tion, which otherwise is considered to be of major impor-tance to prevent postoperative thromboembolism.
Pain control
Despitemuchprogessinourunderstandingofpainphys-
iology [68] and attention from professional and governmentagencies [69,70], routine postoperative pain managementusually remains unsatisfactory [71]. This is unfortunate,since well-established treatment regimens are available [72,73], and the implementation of such programs with theintroduction of acute pain services improves quality of care[69,70]. Furthermore, suf ﬁcient pain relief is a prerequisite
for optimal recovery [74].
Effective treatment of postoperative pain that allows for
early mobilization, may be achieved using a combination ofanalgesic agents or techniques (balanced analgesia) [73].The concept of multimodal or balanced analgesia takesadvantage of the additive or synergistic effects by combin-ing multiple agents. Moreover, with several combination
regimens there is concomitant reduction of side effectsowing to the lower doses of the individual drugs and dif-ferences between drugs in side effect pro ﬁles [73].
The use of simple and safe local anesthetic in ﬁltration
techniques in small operations should be emphasized [75],and the use of continuous epidural techniques for moresevere pain is well established [23,73]. Early mobilizationaftermajorprocedurescanonlyeffectivelybeaccomplishedby utilizing epidural or other local anesthetic techniquesrather than with opioids, nonsteroidal anti-in ﬂammatory
drugs (NSAID), or other systemic analgesics. However, theconcept of opioid-free or opioid-reduced analgesia shouldreceive further attention in the future, as reduction of opi-oid-related side effects may hasten recovery [76]
Antinausea prophylaxis
Postoperative nausea and vomiting are among the most
common postoperative complaints and these problems arean inconvenience and may limit recovery and hospital dis-charge.
Predictive factors for nausea include a previous history
of motion sickness and postoperative vomiting, anxiety,
type of surgical procedure (increased risk during head andneck surgery), dehydration, and female sex [77]. In recentyears, well-designed controlled trials have demonstratedsigniﬁcant antinausea and vomiting effects of proprofol
anesthesia [78] and ondansetron (or other similar drugs)[79]. Moreover, nausea and vomiting were reduced with theomission of nitrous oxide [80]. A single dose of dexameth-asone given preoperatively reduces nausea and vomiting inminor to moderate sized operations [81]. Droperidol is alsoeffective [82]. Finally a recent study suggests that intraop-erative and early postoperative supplemental oxygen mayreduce nausea and vomiting after colonic surgery [83], andthe effects may be as effective as ondansetron [84].
Local anesthesia may provide effective postoperative
pain relief, thereby reducing use of systemic opioid andindirectly reducing nausea and vomiting [85 –87]. Because
the technique of continuous epidural local anesthesia re-duces the need for systemic opioids, this technique will alsoreduce nausea and vomiting as oral intake is possible (seebelow). The use of NSAID ’s to provide early postoperative
analgesia and a 20% to 30% opioid-sparing effect mayreduce nausea and vomiting but further studies are needed[76,88]. Several other pharmacological agents (phenothia-zines, antihistaminics, anticholinergics, and benzamides)may exhibit some antinausea and vomiting effects, but theefﬁcacy of these drugs is less well-established. Metoclopra-
mide is ineffective [89]. Future effective control of nauseaand vomiting probably require multimodal intervention, butdata are not available at this time to allow recommendationfor such combinations [90 –92].

Early enteral nutrition
Traditional care regimens after major operations have
usually included restricted oral intake, which contributes tocatabolism with loss of weight and skeletal muscle. Severalexperimental and clinical studies have demonstrated thatearly enteral nutrition reduces gut permeability (and pre-sumed bacterial translocation) when compared with paren-teral nutrition or late enteral feeding. Some authors suggestthat early enteral feeding may reduce infectious complica-tions and improve outcomes [93,94]. However, several ofthese studies have been performed in patients after acciden-talinjury[93]andtheexactroleofroutineearlyenteraltubefeeding [95,96] or feeding with oral dietary supplementsafter elective procedures remains controversial. In recentyears, more well-described but small studies have beenperformed to suggest that early enteral nutrition is possibleand may be valuable even in selective elective surgicalpatients [61,97,98]. Although theoretically promising, spe-
ciﬁc nutrient pharmacotherapy utilizing immune-enhancing
nutrition also needs further study before this can be recom-mended for routine use, since consistent bene ﬁts have not
been found [95,99-102]. Future improvement in periopera-tive care with effective treatment of nausea, vomiting, andileus (see above), may allow early enteral (oral) nutrition tobecome routine therapy thereby reducing catabolism andlimiting loss of muscle function and postoperative fatigue.Future studies with appropriate analgesic techniques to re-duce ileus [28] need to be performed in order to reevaluatethe role of enteral nutrition on morbidity.
Single factor intervention with additional protein-en-
riched supplements for 10 to 16 weeks after discharge afterabdominalsurgeryhasincreasedbodyweightandleanbodymass [103] while the effect on recovery, hand grip strength,and quality of life could only be demonstrated in depletedpatients [103,104]. These ﬁndings suggest that prolongednutritional therapy has no major bene ﬁt except in depleted
patients.
Postoperative hypoxemia
Postoperative hypoxemia may occur in the early recov-
ery period as a consequence of anesthesia-related effects,and as a late event during the days when the patient isreceiving less acute care [105]. The late postoperative hy-poxemia may occur as a persistent phenomenon or as epi-sodic desaturations, usually occurring at night [106]
The constant hypoxemic response is closely related to
the conventional impairment in pulmonary function andsupine position [107] while episodic desaturations are pre-dominantly related to postoperative sleep disturbances withrebound of REM-sleep during the second to fourth postop-erative night [105,106]. Late postoperative hypoxemia hasbeen identi ﬁed as an important contributing factor to post-
operative cardiac dysfunction (ischemia and arrhythmias)and possibly to myocardial infarction [105]. Decreased tis-sue oxygen tension may also play an important role inwound infection and delayed wound healing as well asdisturbances of cognitive function [105]. Modi ﬁcation of
the usual hypoxemic responses should focus on techniquesto improve postoperative pulmonary function and sleep, orto provide supplemental oxygen. Postoperative pulmonaryfunction can be improved by providing suf ﬁcient analgesia,
where continuous epidural analgesia with local anestheticsis most effective. The position of the patient is important,since the usual supine position during the postoperativeperiod may impair pulmonary function and further reduceoxygen saturation, while mobilization improves pulmonaryfunction and oxygenation [106]. Postoperative sleep distur-bances and episodic desaturations may be improved bysufﬁcient analgesia with regional local anesthetic tech-
niques and reduced use of opioids, which may contribute tosleep disturbances [105,108]
Oxygen administration increases oxygen delivery, but
has no effect on the incidence of episodic desaturations[105]. However, early postoperative oxygen administrationmay reduce nausea and vomiting [83] decrease the inci-dence of surgical wound infection [109], and reduce tachy-cardia [110]. Furthermore, cerebral dysfunction may beimproved [105]. Although no controlled data are availablefrom the late postoperative period, routine oxygen admin-istration is indicated in high-risk patients for the ﬁrst 2-4
days when patients are in the supine position (night time) orwhen oxygen saturation is less than about 93%.
Convalescence
Postoperative convalescence may depend on several fac-
tors of which pain, fatigue, rehabilitation, and speci ﬁc sur-
gical factors are most important [111]. Early postoperativefatigue may be related to distorted sleep resulting fromnoise, drugs (opioids, benodiazepines), and the in ﬂamma-
Fig. 2. Factors that contribute to delayed or accelerated recovery after
elective operations.635 H. Kehlet and D.W. Wilmore / The American Journal of Surgery 183 (2002) 630 –641
tory response (IL-6) [111,112]. Late (weeks) fatigue is re-
lated to loss of weight and muscle mass and associatedweakness [111,113].
Postoperative pain can be effectively treated with multi-
modal analgesia thereby allowing early mobilization (seeabove), and fatigue may be reduced by combined inhibitionof the catabolic response with neural blockade techniques,early nutrition, and mobilization [111]. These approachesappear to be the most important factors to enhance conva-lescent recovery.
Recommendations for care during the convalescent pe-
riod are highly variable [114] and this period of care israrely studied. There seems to be no scienti ﬁc basis for
restrictions of activities of daily living. Studies in animalsshowed a resumption of strenuous physical activity (grey-hound racing) 2 weeks after an abdominal procedure withno deleterious effects [115] whereas convalescence in pa-tients frequently averages 4 to 5 weeks [116]. Although nocontrolled data are available, large, single-center studies ofhernia surgery have shown that recommendations for im-mediateactivitymayshortenconvalescencetoaboutaweekafter inguinal herniorrhaphy [30,117] in contrast to 2 to 4weeks after laparoscopic repair or open herniorrhaphy withtraditional recommendations to limit postoperative activity[118]. Such recommendations regarding convalescence
should be reviewed and adjusted as information based onclinical trials become available.
Interrupting preoperative medications
Recent observations suggest that an increased incidence
of cerebrovascular complications may occur in the postop-erativeperiodwithcessationofchronicallyusedappropriatemedicationaftertheoperation[119].Thisespeciallyappliesto agents such as beta-blockers, antihypertensives, angio-tension converting enzyme inhibitors, benzodiazopams, andantidepressives. These agents should therefore be continuedin the postoperative period.
Potential of multimodality therapy
The risks and morbidity associated with surgical proce-
dures may be determined by multiple factors (Fig. 2). Al-though improvement in operative outcome has beenachieved due to single interventions such as antimicrobialprophylaxis or antithrombotic therapy, further major reduc-tion in morbidity using single intervention approaches mayTable 2

* These data are derived from a hospital data base [121] and large multicenter trials published over the last 5 years. These lengths of stay are generall y

not be possible. Additional improvement in postoperative
outcomes may therefore require more attention by combin-ing efforts from anesthesiologists and surgeons in the intra-operative and early postoperative period (1 to 4 days),where the peak incidence of complications occur.
A rational approach towards control of postoperative
pathophysiology and morbidity may therefore be multimo-dal intervention [120]. Such efforts represent an extensionof conventional “clinical pathways, ”because they integrate
recent data from pain physiology and treatment, anesthesia,surgical technique, enforced feeding and mobilization, andrevision of traditional care programs into an effective post-operative rehabilitation program. The terminology for suchprograms has included such expressions as “fast track ”or
“accelerated recovery programs. ”In recent years, several reports describing fast track pro-
grams have been published (Table 2). A common feature ofthese reports is a reduction of hospital stay with low mor-bidity. Most available data are small-scale nonrandomizedpatient series from single centers.
Therefore, the suggestions from these studies of reduc-
tion of hospital stay, organ dysfunction, and morbidity needfurther assessment with a focus on patient safety after earlydischarge. In addition, a detailed cost analysis should beperformed including the potential for extra costs resultingfrom readmissions and the need for rehabilitation servicesor care provided by home nursing. However, from the fewrandomized trials available patient safety and satisfactionhave been preserved [123,137,140] and cost reduced [124,141] compared with traditional postoperative stay pro-Table 3
Organizational steps necessary to develop a fast track surgical program
Step Personnel involved Speci ﬁc task/estimated Time
required, if applicableComments
1. Develop a plan or critical
pathway.All individuals who interface
with the patientWrite a pathway to be followed.
Meetings lasting 1 –2 hours a week
for 1–2 months.Leader needed with skills in consensus
development, knowledge in processengineering. Identify team memberscommitted to project.
2. Outline speci ﬁcs of preoperative
preparation.1°Surgeon
2°Consulting internistEvaluate need for tests and
preventive strategy to optimizephysiology ( /H1101125 hours).Emphasis on minimizing comorbid
condition such as heart disease, pulmonarydisease, diabetes mellitus, andthromboembolic and infection risk.
3. Develop anesthesia and
analgesia programs.1°Anesthesiologists/pain
service2°Surgeons, nursesOptimize regional techniques to
reduce the stress response andoptimize pain management.Initiation and development ofprogram may require 2 –3 months.May require special training for
anesthesiologists to perform epidural andother neural block techniques. Nurses mayproﬁt by visiting units with protocols in
place to maintain patients pain free for theearly postoperative period.
4. Minimize stress of operation. 1 °Anesthesiologist/surgeon
2°Operating room and
recovery room nursesOptimize anesthetic technique.
Practice minimal invasive surgery.Prevent perioperative hypothermia.Minimize transfusionrequirements.
5. Adjust postoperative care
according to evidence-basedstudies.1°Surgeon
2°Nursing staffModify practice regarding drains,
tubes, catheters, etc. Have standardprotocols for feeding andambulation.Standardize postoperative orders. Staff may
proﬁt by a visit to a center practicing fast
track surgery.
6. Develop postoperative nursing
care programs.1°Nurses, nursing assistant
2°Physiotherapists,
dieticiansEnforce feeding, ambulation, and
sleeping protocols.Staff may bene ﬁt by visiting to a center
already practicing fast track surgery.
7. Determine patient follow-up. 1 °Surgeon
2°Nurse practitioner,
surgical assistantProvide a system for telephone
follow-up and of ﬁce visit by
senior members of the team.Protocols should be developed for speci ﬁc
and rapid responses to pain, nausea andvomiting, wound drainage, and othercomplaints that traditionally requirereadmission.
8. Develop a patient information
program.All team members, possibly
headed by a nursepractitioner or patienteducator.Develop oral, written, and video
material to educate patient beforethe operation.
9. Document results, tabulate
problems and patientsatisfaction. Revise and improveprogram.All team members, possibly
headed by a data manager.Develop outcome measures and
methods of follow-up.May require speci ﬁc training in outcome
research.
Fast track recommendation for speci ﬁc procedures are found in the references cited in Table 2. 1 °/H11005primary personnel; 2 °/H11005secondary personnel.637 H. Kehlet and D.W. Wilmore / The American Journal of Surgery 183 (2002) 630 –641
grams. In addition, pharmacological, sympathetic blockade
that reduces cardiac demands and mortality, will probablybe utilized to enhance outcome in the future [142,143].
A prerequisite for an “accelerated recovery program ”is
a multidisciplinary collaboration that requires organizationto successfully interface between the patient, the surgeon,the anesthesiologist, physiotherapist, and surgical nurse(Table 3). Such programs therefore represent an expansionof the function of the more traditional acute pain service.Other characteristics of the programs are nurse specializa-tion, direction of patients after speci ﬁc operations to as-
signed areas of care (ie, specialized units), optimal use ofregional anesthetic techniques and balanced analgesia, opi-oid-free or opioid-reduced analgesia, and a willingness toreconsider and revise the use and necessity of traditionalpostoperative care principles (drains, tubes, catheters, re-strictions, and so forth).
It should be emphasized that accelerated recovery and
fast track surgical programs are based on the concept thatmultimodal intervention may reduce stress induced organdysfunction and the accompanying morbidity that results inthe subsequent need for hospitalization. This may havemajor social economic implications, in contrast to the ef-fects of modifying only one single factor (hospital stay),which may have minimal impacts on overall costs [144].
In summary, recent developments in the understanding
ofperioperativepathophysiologyandtheimplementationofcareregimenstoattenuatethestressofanoperation,suggestthatacomprehensiverevisionofpostoperativecaretowardsaccelerated rehabilitation may decrease morbidity and theneed for hospitalization with increased satisfaction andsafety after discharge. Development and improvement ofmultimodal intervention within the context of fast tracksurgery programs represent the major challenge for themedical professions working to achieve a pain and risk freeperioperative course.
