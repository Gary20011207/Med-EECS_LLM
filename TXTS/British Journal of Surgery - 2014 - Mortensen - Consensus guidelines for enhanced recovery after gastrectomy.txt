      Background:  Application of evidence-based perioperative care protocols reduces complication rates,
      accelerates recovery and shortens hospital stay. Presently, there are no comprehensive guidelines for
      perioperative care for gastrectomy.
      Methods: An international working group within the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS®) Soci-
      ety assembled an evidence-based comprehensive framework for optimal perioperative care for patients
      undergoing gastrectomy. Data were retrieved from standard databases and personal archives. Evidence
      and recommendations were classified according to     the Grading of      Recommendations,  Assessment,
      Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system   and were discussed until consensus was reached within
      the group. The quality of evidence was rated ‘high’, ‘moderate’, ‘low’ or ‘very low’. Recommendations
      were graded as ‘strong’ or ‘weak’.
      Results: The available evidence has been summarized and recommendations are given for 25 items, eight
      of which contain procedure-specific evidence. The quality of evidence varies substantially and further
      research is needed for many issues to improve the strength of evidence and grade of recommendations.
      Conclusion: The present evidence-based framework provides comprehensive advice on optimal peri-
      operative care for the patient undergoing gastrectomy and facilitates multi-institutional prospective
      cohort registries and adequately powered randomized trials for further research.
