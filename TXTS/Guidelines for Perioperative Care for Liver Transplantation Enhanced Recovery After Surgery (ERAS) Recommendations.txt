Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal, evidence-based, program of care developed to minimize the response to surgical stress, associated with reduced perioperative morbidity and hospital stay. This study presents the specific ERAS Society recommendations for liver transplantation (LT) based on the best available evidence and on expert consensus Methods. PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched in April 2019 for published and ongoing randomized clinical trials on LT in the last 15 y. Studies were selected by 5 independent reviewers and were eligible if focusing on each validated ERAS item in the area of adult LT. An e-Delphi method was used with an extended interdisciplinary panel of experts to validate the final recommendations. Results. Forty-three articles were included in the systematic review. A consensus was reached among experts after the second round. Patients should be screened for malnutrition and treated whenever possible. Prophylactic nasogastric intubation and prophylactic abdominal drainage may be omitted, and early extubation should be considered. Early oral intake, mobilization, and multimodal-balanced analgesia are recommended. Conclusions. The current ERAS recommendations were elaborated based on the best available evidence and endorsed by the e-Delphi method. Nevertheless, prospective studies need to confirm the clinical use of the suggested protocol. (Transplantation 2022;106: 552¡V561). Received 20 June 2020. Revision received 5 January 2021.

Nevertheless, little evidence exists on the application of an ERAS program in LT, apart from 2 feasibility studies reporting on the effectiveness of such a program on the length of stay after LT.19,20 This study aims to develop the specific ERAS Society recommendations for LT based on the best available evidence and on expert consensus. MATERIALS AND METHODS An international panel of liver transplant surgeons and anesthesiologists from 12 international centers, including the steering committee (Li?ge, Belgium; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Montreal, Canada; Torino, Italy; Pisa, Italy; Kyoto, Japan; Groningen, the Netherlands; Paris, France; Alicante, Spain; Gen?ve, Switzerland; Portland, USA; and Edinburgh, UK) were invited to participate. These guidelines were realized according to the recommendations from the ERAS Society for standards for the development of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery21 and the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation recommendations,22 with LT surgeons, anesthesiologists, or LT hepatologists as target users. Items Analyzed The ERAS Guidelines for Liver Surgery5 were used as a working basis to develop the present guidelines, including the list of examined items. Hence, given some particular aspects of LT, a preliminary draft including the list of items on which the guideline would focus was submitted for approval to all the experts. These agreed to remove the Mechanical/Oral bowel preparation item, considered as irrelevant in LT context, and ¡§prehabilitation,¡¨ ¡§temporary portocaval shunt,¡¨ ¡§early extubation,¡¨ and ¡§postoperative education¡¨ items were added. The final list included 22 items. According to the methodology used for the development of the previous ERAS guidelines on Liver Surgery,5 22 different search equations were realized, 1 for each keywords group defining a validated ERAS item (preadmission counseling, prehabilitation, fluid and carbohydrate loading, no prolonged fasting, no/selective bowel preparation, antibiotic prophylaxis, thromboprophylaxis, no premedication, shortacting anesthetic agents, temporary portocaval shunt, mid-thoracic epidural anesthesia, no drains, avoidance of salt and water overload, maintenance of normothermia, no nasogastric tubes, prevention of nausea and vomiting, early extubation, early removal of catheter, early oral nutrition, early mobilization, nonopioid oral analgesia, stimulation of gut motility, postoperative education, and audit of compliance and outcomes). Literature Search and Data Extraction The coordinator center (Piti? Salp?tri?re, Paris, France) realized a digital search Medline through PubMed for published studies and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials, focusing on each validated ERAS item in the area of LT. Each single validated ERAS item was defined by a group of specific keywords extracted from official ERAS guidelines and 1 pilot study on ERAS and LT.2,3,5,19,23,24 Participants/Population Human adult patients (18 y or older) undergoing LT, with a graft (whole or split) coming from a deceased (after a brain or circulatory death) or living donor, no matter the indication for LT. Articles focusing on re-transplantation or combined LT (with kidney, heart, lung, pancreas, or intestine) were not considered because of different patterns of morbidity and mortality. Studies focusing on pediatric LT and experimental studies including animals were not considered for inclusion.

According to the ERAS protocol, interventions could be during the preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative period immediately after LT. Comparator(s)/Control None. Main Outcome(s) Outcomes assessed: all primary outcomes reported in the result section were extracted with the related definition, and severity score when provided. Measures of effect were classed (eg clinical outcome, surgical outcome, mortality, morbidity, recovery outcome, and patients reported outcomes)25 as well as the direction of effect (in favor vs against). Setting No restriction on study location or settings was applied. Language We will consider articles reported in English, French, German, Italian, or Portuguese. Studies in other languages will be included only if the translation can be adequately obtained through Google translate. Types of Study Included Were considered for inclusion prospective or retrospective studies (cohorts or registry), case¡Vcontrol, or randomized clinical trials (RCTs). If relevant, reviews and meta-analyses were evaluated for inclusion. Case reports were excluded, as well as any study including 80% the of experts rated the item within the highest region of the scale (7, 8, or 9 on the 9-point Likert scale).41 Once consensus was reached for a given item, that item was removed and no longer proposed in the following round. Experts were given 2wk to respond to each round, followed by 2 reminders to complete the questionnaire that was sent out after 7 and 14 d. A 2-wk interval between rounds was used to summarize the data and develop the next questionnaire. We did not plan an external revision of final recommendations, but an updating procedure will be proposed every 5 y. RESULTS Among the 2685 references identified by the PubMed search, 43 were included. From the search on Clinicatrials.gov, we identified 62 references and included 6 ongoing trials. The selection process is detailed in Figure 1, and the complete list of trials can be found in Supplemental Material Study List (SDC, http:// links.lww.com/TP/C225). FIGURE 1.

The design was prospective in 25 (55.8%) of included studies, with 12 (27.9%) randomized. The experimental intervention was nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and combined in 23 (53.5%), 19 (44.2%), and 1 (2.3%) of studies. The indication of LT was detailed in 32 studies (74.4%), with the use of deceased donor graft, living donor liver transplantation or both reported in 15 (34.9%), 9 (20.9%), and 3 (7.0%) of cases, respectively. The reported level of evidence according to the GRADE29 was rated as high in 3 (7%), moderate in 16 (37.2%), low in 16 (37.2%), and very low in 7 (16.3%) of the 43 published references. More details are presented in Table 1. e-Delphi Process Results Among the 27 experts invited, 21 (81%) replied from 12 international LT centers reporting a median volume of 70 (40¡V112.5) LT per year: n = 7 centers reported FIGURE 2.

Summary of ERAS recommendations for each item and the respective level of evidence ERAS item Summary Evidence level Grade of recommendation 1. Preoperative counseling Patients on the waiting list should receive dedicated, multidisciplinary educational counseling.47,48 Low Strong 2. Prehabilitation Adapted physical therapy: there is no evidence yet of the benefit or harm of physical exercise in cirrhotic patients before liver transplantation.49,50 Low Weak Preoperative nutritional screening: patients with cirrhosis should be screened for malnutrition, using a validated tool, and addressed to a multidisciplinary team for nutritional intervention.51,52 Moderate Strong Preoperative nutrition: cirrhotic patients malnourished or in the preoperative period should receive 30¡V35 kcal ¡Ñ kg?1 ¡Ñ d?1 and a protein intake of 1.5g ¡Ñ kg?1 ¡Ñ d?1, through a standard nutrition regimen minimizing periods of starvation, with no need of protein restriction in case of HE.51 High Strong Probiotics: some evidence supports the use of probiotics, before, or on the day of liver transplantation. The duration of the treatment and the number of strains included are variable across the studies.53,54 High Weak Preoperative immunonutrition: the available evidence is nonconclusive, and no recommendation can be given for systematic IN before LT.55 High Weak 3. Perioperative fasting and carbohydrate loading Preoperative fasting: preoperative fasting does not need to exceed 6 h for solids and 2 h for liquids. Caution should be considered in case of risk factors for delayed gastric emptying (tense ascites, diabetes, or autonomic dysfunction).5,51 Low Strong Carbohydrate loading: carbohydrate loading may be recommended at patient admission for liver transplantation, at least 2h before induction of anesthesia.5,56 Caution should be considered in case of risk factors for delayed gastric emptying (tense ascites, diabetes, or autonomic dysfunction). Low Weak 4. Antimicrobial prophylaxis It is recommended to administer antibiotic prophylaxis only during the intraoperative period. Extending the duration of prophylaxis does not provide any advantages. Systematic selective digestive decontamination is not recommended.57,58 Moderate Strong 5. Antithrombotic prophylaxis Antithrombotic prophylaxis: there is no evidence in favor or against thrombotic prophylaxis, but compressive stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices during LT may be recommended. Very low Weak Anticoagulation prophylaxis: there is insufficient evidence to provide any formal recommendation on antiaggregation or anticoagulation. When available, the viscoelastic coagulation monitoring may be used to guide the therapeutic decision. Very low Weak 6. Anesthetic premedication Long-acting anxiolytic drugs should be avoided. Dose-adjusted, short-acting anxiolytics may be considered in selected patients. Very low Weak 7. Incision The choice of incision is at the surgeon¡¦s discretion, depending on the graft and patient¡¦s morphology. Mercedes-type incision may probably be avoided due to higher risk of incisional hernia. Low Weak 8. Temporary portocaval shunt The available pieces of evidence suggest that the use of a temporary portocaval surgical shunt may be beneficial in reducing the red blood cell transfusion requirement, length of stay, PNF, and mortality rates.59,60 Its use is however submitted to the surgeon and anesthesiologist¡¦s decision during surgery. Low Weak 9. Short-acting anesthetic protocol Short-acting anesthetics can be considered in LT, and within anesthetic gases, little evidence suggest that sevoflurane may be preferred to desflurane.61 Cerebral or nociception monitoring anesthetic titration may be critically used. Neuromuscular monitoring should guide the appropriate level of muscle relaxation and reversal. Low Strong 10. Perioperative analgesia We recommend using multimodal and balanced analgesia to manage perioperative analgesia after LT. There is not enough published evidence to state in favor or against opioid-sparing management: PCA-based morphine may be considered, with caution among patients at high risk for delirium. TAP block may be considered, while TEA cannot be recommended after LT.62,63 Low Strong 11. Early extubation Each patient undergoing LT should be screened for eligibility for early extubation (75¡V100 LT/y42-44). The round-1 questionnaire was sent in November 2019, and data collection was completed within 3 mo, in February 2020. Figure 2 gives further information on the e-Delphi panel, with an average 15.7 ¡Ó 7.86 y of experience. After round 1, a consensus was reached for 16 of 22 criteria, with 2 of them requiring minor rewording. Changes were made to the wording used to describe the criteria, prompted by the panel¡¦s suggestions, and after round 2, consensus was reached for all the remaining criteria. Figure 3 shows the trend of consensus rating for each criterion across the last 2 rounds. Within Table 2 are summarized the ERAS recommendations for each item and the respective level of evidence, and in the Supplemental Material Supporting Text (SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/C225) is exposed the rationale for each recommendation. DISCUSSION This systematic review highlights how currently available evidence on enhanced recovery pathways in LT is scarce and lacks standardization. The highest level of evidence (level 1 or 2) was available for 13 of 22 items. Although the value of ERAS pathways has now been demonstrated in the liver, colorectal and pancreas surgery showing benefit in morbidity, cost, and medico-economic outcomes, there is a clear need to perform high-quality studies to confirm the benefit of ERAS pathways in LT. In conclusion, the proposed ERAS pathway for LT is based on the best available evidence, which still needs to be further explored. To allow benchmarking and comparison across trials using the new proposed LT ERAS recommendations, there is a need for consensual and standardized outcomes in LT, which are currently lacking.25 In this line, standardized and consensual checklist criteria to assess readiness for hospital discharge (or functional recovery) after LT was recently proposed.45 Moreover, as highlighted by Muller et al. 46 in a multicenter analysis to define benchmarks in LT, 82% of patients developed at least 1 complication during 1-y follow-up. When the latter is taken into account, probably the weight of morbidity as an outcome in ERAS guidelines validation should be reconsidered. Lastly, as with all existing ERAS pathways, the assessment of adherence to the protocol (compliance) is of utmost importance, and the compliance with the new proposed LT ERAS protocol should be documented, as part of the further trial to allow benchmarking. Intraoperative blood product management: when available, viscoelastic tests as thromboelastography or rotational thromboelastometry might be used to drive the management of blood products and factor concentrates during LT.69 Low Weak 14. Perioperative normothermia Perioperative normothermia should be maintained during liver transplantation.70,71 Low Strong 15. Prophylactic nasogastric probe Indirect evidence suggests that a routine postoperative nasogastric probe after liver transplantation is not indicated. Nasogastric tubes placed during surgery should be removed before reversal of anesthesia. Low Strong 16. Postoperative nausea and vomiting Indirect evidence suggests the use of a multimodal approach to PONV, with 2 antiemetic drugs as prophylaxis (eg 5-HT3 antagonist and steroids). Low Strong 17. Early oral nutrition Normal food oral intake and/or enteral nutrition (nasogastric tube or jejunostomy) should be started 12¡V24 h after liver transplantation, according to the patient¡¦s tolerance. Parenteral nutrition should be considered as the very last option when the use of oral route (enteral feeding tubes or jejunostomy) is not possible.51 Very low Strong Nutritional supplements: there is no clear evidence of the benefit of nutritional supplements after liver transplantation.72,73 Low Weak 18. Early mobilization Early mobilization after LT should be encouraged with early-goal-directed interventions, from the morning after LT until hospital discharge.74-76 Physical rehabilitation may be continued after discharge. Moderate Strong 19. Glycemic control We recommend a protocolized approach to blood glucose management in LT patients targeting an upper blood glucose level of ? 180mg/dL from the intraoperative period to the early postoperative period (first 24-48 h postoperatively in the absence of complications and/or organ failure).77-80 Moderate Strong 20. Postoperative ileus There are no acknowledged strategies to prevent postoperative ileus after LT. Low Weak 21. Postoperative education Systematic educational programs after liver transplantation may increase patient awareness and knowledge on immunosuppressive therapy and on physical changes after LT. Such multidisciplinary programs could include a clinical pharmacist and should be continued over a long period after liver transplantation.80-82 Low Strong 22. Audit Systematic audit improves compliance and clinical outcome in healthcare practice.2,4,5 Moderate Strong ERAS, enhanced recovery after surgery; HE, hepatic encephalopathy; IN, immunonutrition; LT, liver transplantation; PCA, patient controlled analgesia; PNF, primary non function; PONV, postoperative nausea and vomiting; TAP, transversus abdominis plane block; TEA, thoracic epidural analgesia; TEE, transesophageal echocardiography.
