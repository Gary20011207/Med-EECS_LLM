Preoperative care1. Preoperative Education & CounselingCurrent ERAS protocols strongly emphasize the importance of preoperative patient education and counseling. Providing information before surgery helps shape realistic patient expectations and reduces anxiety, which is crucial for lumbar surgery, often perceived as having uncertain outcomes and prolonged recovery. Patients who receive adequate education report higher satisfaction levels. Although a systematic review including seven RCTs showed limited evidence for reducing pain or length of stay, education is still recommended due to its low risk and logical benefit. Consistent written materials should also be provided.• Recommendation: Preoperative education and counseling is recommended.• Quality of evidence: Low• Recommendation grade: Strong2. PrehabilitationPrehabilitation refers to enhancing functional capacity before surgery via exercise, nutrition, and psychological preparation. Although it has shown benefits in general surgery, it hasn't been proven effective in orthopedic surgeries like hip or knee replacement. For spine surgery, a systematic review of three RCTs found insufficient evidence to determine benefit. It may be helpful in specific populations (e.g., elderly, frail, psychiatric comorbidities), but further research is needed.• Recommendation: Not routinely recommended due to insufficient evidence.• Quality of evidence: Insufficient• Recommendation grade: Not applicable3. Preoperative Nutritional Assessment & InterventionMalnutrition is associated with increased risk of surgical site infections, complications, longer hospital stays, readmissions, and mortality. Nutritional status should be assessed using labs (e.g., albumin), anthropometrics, and tools like the Mini Nutritional Assessment. When malnutrition is detected, dietary advice, protein fortification, and oral supplements should be provided. A trial showed that nutritional supplementation led to shorter stays and improved postoperative labs.• Recommendation 1: Preoperative nutritional assessment is recommended.• Recommendation 2: Nutritional intervention is advised for malnourished patients.• Quality of evidence: Low• Recommendation grade: Strong (both)4. Smoking CessationSmoking increases perioperative and postoperative complications including pulmonary/cardiovascular events, pseudoarthrosis, poor outcomes, DVT, delirium, morbidity, and mortality. A meta-analysis showed each week of cessation before surgery reduces complication risk by ~19%. At least 4 weeks of cessation is recommended, ideally with nicotine replacement therapy and counseling. Continued smoking post-surgery increases recurrence of disk herniation, opioid use, and pseudoarthrosis risk.• Recommendation: Minimum 4-week preoperative smoking cessation with support therapy.• Quality of evidence: Moderate• Recommendation grade: Strong5. Alcohol CessationDaily alcohol intake over 2 units increases postoperative complication risks like pseudoarthrosis, infection, cardiopulmonary issues, ileus, delirium, bleeding, and DVT. Meta-analyses (including Cochrane reviews) suggest 4–8 weeks of cessation before surgery lowers complication rates, although not mortality. Programs may include behavioral therapy, disulfiram, vitamins, or benzodiazepines.• Recommendation: Alcohol cessation 4–8 weeks preoperatively is advised.• Quality of evidence: Moderate• Recommendation grade: Strong6. Preoperative Fasting & Carbohydrate LoadingTraditional "nothing by mouth after midnight" is outdated. Guidelines recommend allowing clear fluids up to 2 hours and solid foods up to 6 hours before anesthesia. This does not increase aspiration risk. As for oral carbohydrate loading (CHO), although it reduces insulin resistance in other surgeries, two RCTs in spine surgery showed no clear benefit. Thus, CHO loading is not routinely recommended for spinal fusion.• Recommendation 1: Allow clear fluids until 2 hours and solids until 6 hours pre-anesthesia.o Quality of evidence: Higho Recommendation grade: Strong• Recommendation 2: Routine CHO loading not currently supported.o Quality of evidence: Insufficiento Recommendation grade: Not applicable7. Pre-anesthetic Medication & Preemptive AnalgesiaPreoperative anxiety is common and may increase pain medication needs. While sedatives like benzodiazepines can reduce anxiety, they are associated with neurocognitive side effects and increased postoperative risks. Thus, routine sedative use is discouraged. In contrast, preemptive use of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and gabapentinoids is recommended. These reduce pain scores, opioid use, and related side effects like nausea, pruritus, and urinary retention. Dosing should be adjusted based on age, renal function, and comorbidities.• Recommendation 1: Avoid routine use of sedatives for anxiety.o Quality of evidence: Lowo Recommendation grade: Strong• Recommendation 2: Use acetaminophen, NSAIDs, gabapentinoids preoperatively for multimodal analgesia.o Quality of evidence: Moderateo Recommendation grade: Strong8. Anemia ManagementPreoperative anemia is present in about one-third of surgical patients and is linked to increased transfusion risk, infection, LOS, and readmission. Data show all levels of anemia correlate with worse 30-day outcomes after elective spine surgery. Treatment options include oral/IV iron or erythropoietin to target hemoglobin ≥13 g/dL, though this threshold is debated. Anemia screening protocols reduce transfusion needs, critical care use, and cost. Referral to hematology may be appropriate if needed.• Recommendation: Assess and correct anemia preoperatively.• Quality of evidence: Low• Recommendation grade: StrongPostoperative care1. Postoperative AnalgesiaPoor postoperative pain control affects approximately 57% of patients after elective spine surgery. Inadequate acute pain management is associated with chronic pain development, systemic inflammatory responses, organ dysfunction, and worsened recovery.A standardized perioperative multimodal analgesia protocol is recommended to improve outcomes. Key components include:• Acetaminophen (paracetamol): Widely used (oral or IV); analgesic and antipyretic, but not anti-inflammatory. It enhances the effect of NSAIDs and opioids. Despite the risk of liver toxicity, it's considered safe and cost-effective.• NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors: Strong evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses shows their effectiveness in pain reduction and opioid-sparing. COX-2 inhibitors are preferred when there are bleeding concerns. While concerns about NSAIDs impairing bone fusion exist, short-term (<2 weeks) perioperative use does not appear to hinder fusion rates.• Opioids: Effective for acute pain but should be minimized due to side effects. Opioid-sparing strategies using multimodal regimens are strongly encouraged.• Other adjuncts studied in other surgeries include gabapentin, alpha-2 agonists, S-ketamine, magnesium sulfate, corticosteroids, and local anesthetic infusions. However, high-level evidence is lacking specifically for spine surgery.Summary/Recommendation:Routine use of multimodal analgesia to improve pain control and reduce opioid use is recommended.Quality of evidence: ModerateRecommendation grade: Strong2. Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)PONV affects 30–50% of all surgical patients, and up to 80% in high-risk groups. It contributes to dehydration, delayed nutrition, increased IV fluid needs, longer hospital stays, and higher costs.Risk factors include:• Female gender• History of PONV or motion sickness• Non-smoking status• Use of volatile anesthetics, nitrous oxide, and opioidsManagement recommendations:• Preoperative risk assessment (e.g., Apfel or Koivuranta scores)• Multimodal prophylaxis based on risk• If rescue is needed, use a different antiemetic class than used in prophylaxis• First-line options: 5-HT3 antagonists (ondansetron), D2 antagonists (droperidol), corticosteroids (dexamethasone)• Second-line: antihistamines, anticholinergics, metoclopramide (limited by side effects)Summary/Recommendation:Risk-based PONV prevention, multimodal prophylaxis, and class-alternating rescue therapy are recommended.Quality of evidence: HighRecommendation grade: Strong3. Postoperative Drain ManagementSubfascial drains are commonly used in lumbar fusion, primarily intended to reduce surgical site infections (SSI) and epidural hematoma (PEH). However:• Four RCTs showed no significant benefit in preventing SSI or PEH• Prolonged drainage may actually increase SSI risk• Drains may delay mobilization and increase surgical site pain, particularly in short-segment, minimally invasive surgeriesSummary/Recommendation:Routine drain use is not recommended in short-segment lumbar fusion.Quality of evidence: ModerateRecommendation grade: Strong4. Thromboembolism ProphylaxisThe incidence of symptomatic DVT (0–3.5%) and PE (0–7.6%) after elective spinal surgery is low. There's limited high-quality evidence on optimal thromboprophylaxis, but:• Early ambulation is strongly recommended for all patients.• Mechanical prophylaxis (compression stockings, pneumatic compression devices) is effective, low-cost, and low-risk.• Pharmacological (chemical) prophylaxis is controversial, due to:o Low overall VTE risko Risk of epidural hematomao Conflicting evidence on efficacyPharmaceutical prophylaxis should be reserved for high-risk groups, including:• Elderly• Patients with neurological deficits• Prior VTE history• Surgery for trauma, deformity, or metastasisSummary/Recommendation:• Early ambulation and mechanical prophylaxis are recommended for all patients.o Quality of evidence: Moderateo Recommendation grade: Strong• Chemical prophylaxis is not recommended routinely; it should be reserved for high-risk patients only.o Quality of evidence: Lowo Recommendation grade: Strong5. Early Mobilization and In-Hospital Physical TherapyProlonged bed rest leads to negative physiological effects: insulin resistance, muscle atrophy, pulmonary compromise, impaired oxygenation, and increased VTE risk. Though no level 1 spine-specific studies exist, cohort studies support early mobilization’s benefit in reducing morbidity and hospital stay.• Mobilization as early as the day of surgery (e.g., walking 30 feet/10 meters) is linked to shorter LOS.• Physical therapists should be involved early, especially in high-risk patients (e.g., those with kinesiophobia or chronic pain).• Patients should be independently mobile before discharge, including stair climbing.Summary/Recommendation:Early mobilization and early physical therapy are recommended.Quality of evidence: LowRecommendation grade: Strong6. Continuous Improvement and AuditImplementation of ERAS protocols in other specialties has shown reduced complications, shorter hospital stays, and improved cost-effectiveness. However, just having an ERAS protocol is not sufficient—ongoing audit and feedback are critical.• Monitoring and process evaluation are key for success.• Regular audits improve compliance, staff performance, and patient satisfaction.• Multidisciplinary teams are essential for effective ERAS implementation.Summary/Recommendation:Routine audit and feedback are necessary for successful ERAS implementation and continuous quality improvement.Quality of evidence: LowRecommendation grade: Strong
