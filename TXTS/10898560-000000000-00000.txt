Abstract Postoperative pain continues to be inadequately managed. While opioids
remain the mainstay for postoperative analgesia, their use can be associated
with adverse effects, including ileus, which can prolong hospital stay. A
number of studies have investigated the use of perioperative intravenous
lidocaine infusion for improving postoperative analgesia and enhancingrecovery of bowel function.
This systematic review was performed to determine the overall efficacy of
intravenous lidocaine infusion on postoperative analgesia and recovery fromsurgery in patients undergoing various surgical procedures. We searched thedatabases of MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library from 1966 to
December 2009. We searched for randomized controlled comparisons of
lidocaine infusion with placebo in the surgical setting and reporting on post-operative analgesia and other aspects of patient recovery from surgery. The
quality of all included studies was assessed using the Modified Oxford Scale.REVIEW ARTICLEDrugs 2010; 70 (9): 1149-1163

Information on postoperative pain intensity and analgesic requirements was
extracted from the trials and compared qualitatively. Other relevant data
such as return of bowel function, length of hospital stay, intraoperative an-
aesthetic requirement and adverse effects were also compared.
Sixteen trials were included. A total of 395 patients received intravenous
lidocaine with 369 controls. In open and laparoscopic abdominal surgery, aswell as in ambulatory surgery patients, intravenous perioperative infusion oflidocaine resulted in significant reductions in postoperative pain intensity andopioid consumption. Pain scores were reduced at rest and with cough or
movement for up to 48 hours postoperatively. Opioid consumption was re-
duced by up to 85% in lidocaine-treated patients when compared with con-
trols. Infusion of lidocaine also resulted in earlier return of bowel function,
allowing for earlier rehabilitation and shorter duration of hospital stay. First
flatus occurred up to 23 hours earlier, while first bowel movement occurredup to 28 hours earlier in the lidocaine-treated patients. Duration of hospital
stay was reduced by an average of 1.1 days in the lidocaine-treated patients.
Administration of intravenous lidocaine infusion did not result in toxicity orclinically significant adverse events. Lidocaine had no impact on postopera-
tive analgesia in patients undergoing tonsillectomy, total hip arthroplasty or
coronary artery bypass surgery.
In conclusion, intravenous lidocaine infusion in the perioperative period is
safe and has clear advantages in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
Patients receiving lidocaine infusion had lower pain scores, reduced post-
operative analgesic requirements and decreased intraoperative anaestheticrequirements, as well as faster return of bowel function and decreased length
of hospital stay. Further studies are needed to assess whether lidocaine has a
beneficial effect in patients undergoing other types of surgery and to determinethe optimum dose, timing and duration of infusion of lidocaine in this setting.
Opioids remain the mainstay for postoperative
analgesia. However, the use of opioids can be
associated with an increased incidence of post-operative complications, such as respiratorydepression, sedation, postoperative nausea andvomiting (PONV), ileus and urinary retention.
[1]
Recent data also suggest that extensive use ofopioids may be associated with hyperalgesia andallodynia.
[2]Therefore, there is a continuous
search for adjuvant therapies to reduce the dosesof opioids and their related adverse effects,thereby improving patient recovery.
Lidocaine is an amide local anaesthetic that
has analgesic, antihyperalgesic
[3]and anti-inflam-
matory[4]properties. It has been previously shown
to be an effective analgesic in a number of set-tings, including cancer pain,
[5]chronic pain[6]and
pain due to adiposis dolorosa.[7,8]These propertiesof lidocaine are mediated by a variety of mech-
anisms, including sodium channel blockade,[4]
inhibition of G protein-coupled receptors[4,9]and
NMDA receptors.[10,11]A number of studies have
been published to assess the analgesic effect of
perioperative intravenous infusion of lidocaine.We therefore performed this systemic review toassess the efficacy of perioperative intravenousinfusion of lidocaine on postoperative outcomes,including pain scores, opioid consumption, opioid-related adverse effects and duration of hospitalstay.
1. Literature Search and Data Extraction
We searched the databases of MEDLINE,
CINAHL and the Cochrane Library from 1966
to December 2009 for studies assessing the1150 McCarthy et al.

impact of perioperative intravenous infusion of
lidocaine on pain outcomes and patient recovery.The following terms were used for the search:‘lidocaine’, ‘intravenous’, ‘pain’, ‘postoperative’and ‘surgery’. Bibliographies of retrieved articleswere also screened for additional studies. The
quality of all included studies were assessed using
the Modified Oxford Scale.
[12]
We designed a data collection form and ex-
tracted data from the included studies on (i) typeof surgery; (ii) number of patients and groupsincluded; (iii) lidocaine regimens (timing andduration); (iv) intraoperative anaesthetic require-ments; (v) pain scores; (vi) analgesic consump-tion; (vii) return of bowel function; (viii) adverseeffects; and (ix) duration of hospital stay.
2. Results
Of 199 articles retrieved by electronic search-
ing, 183 were excluded for the following reasons:
5 were letters or literature reviews, 37 were studies
on intravenous regional anaesthesia, 17 were stud-ies involving neuraxial lidocaine, 37 were studieson topical, local or peripheral nerve blocks, 5were studies using lidocaine as a rescue analgesic,4 were animal studies and 78 were not relevant toour study criteria (figure 1). The 16 selectedrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) included atotal of 764 patients: 395 received lidocaine with369 controls.
Of the 16 included studies, 12 were in
abdominal surgery, of which 8 were open
[13-20]
and 4 were laparoscopic,[21-24]1 was in ortho-
paedic surgery,[25]1 was in cardiac surgery,[26]
1 was in tonsillectomies[27]and 1 included a
variety of ambulatory surgeries.[28]The minimum
Modified Oxford Scale score of an included trialwas 2 and the maximum was 7.
2.1 Abdominal Surgery
2.1.1 Open Abdominal Surgery
In patients undergoing open abdominal
surgeries, lidocaine infusion was given as aninitial intravenous bolus dose of 100 mg
[13,14]or
1.5–2m g/kg prior to induction or incision,[15-18,20]
followed by an infusion of lidocaine at a rate of1.5–3m g/kg/hour
[16-18,20]or 2–3m g/minute.[13-15]Infusions were stopped at the end of surgery[17,20]
or continued for up to 24 hours postopera-tively.
[13-16,18,19]Harvey et al.[19]used a lidocaine
infusion at 1 mg /minute without a bolus dose,
which was started immediately postoperativelyfor 24 hours (table I).
Pain scores were reported in seven of the eight
studies, of which five showed a significant re-duction in pain scores.
[13,15-17,20]There was also a
trend towards lower pain scores in the two studiesthat did not report a statistically significant re-duction in pain scores.
[18,19]In the first of these,
a study by Herroeder et al.[18]on colorectal
patients, there were no significant differences inpain scores, at rest or during cough, between thetwo groups, although there was a tendency to-wards lower visual analogue scale (VAS) scores in
the lidocaine group than in the placebo group
from 0 to 156 hours postoperatively. Similarly,the trial by Harvey et al.
[19]reported no signif-
icant difference in VAS scores; however, a trendtoward lower VAS scores was noted at 24 hoursafter surgery in the lidocaine group (table I).
Five of eight trials that involved open intra-
abdominal surgery reported a significant reductionin total analgesic consumption in the post-operative period up to 48 –72 hours.
[13-17]These
reductions ranged from 33 %to 35 %when the
lidocaine infusion was maintained for 0 –1 hour
postoperatively,[16,17]and up to 83 %compared183 excluded:

with the placebo group when the lidocaine infu-
sion was maintained for 24 hours postopera-tively.
[13,14]In radical prostatectomy patients,
lidocaine infusion was maintained for 1 hourpostoperatively and resulted in a 50 %reduction
in morphine requirements in the postanaesthesia
care unit (PACU) but not on the ward.
[15]One
study involving colorectal surgery in which the
lidocaine infusion was maintained for 4 hoursafter surgery reported no difference in overallpiritramide consumption at any time interval.
[18]
In a more recent study in abdominal hyster-ectomy patients, the lidocaine infusion wasmaintained intraoperatively only and no differ-ence in patient-controlled epidural analgesiause postoperatively was found.
[20]Lidocaine in-
fusion begun postoperatively and administered
for 24 hours after small bowel and colorectal
surgery also resulted in no difference in post-operative morphine consumption (table I).
[19]
Six of the eight studies reported data on return
of bowel function after open abdominal sur-gery.
[14-19]Five studies showed that lidocaine
significantly accelerated return of bowel func-tion.
[14,15,17-19]First passage of flatus occurred
8–24 hours earlier[15,17,18]and the first bowel
movement occurred 12 –28 hours earlier[15,18,19]in
lidocaine-treated patients compared with placebo
recipients. In the study by Rimback et al.,[14]
evidence of significantly earlier return of propul-
sive motility in the colon was shown in thelidocaine-treated group. Radiopaque markers inthe lidocaine group were propelled significantlyearlier from the cecum /ascending colon to the
transverse colon and appeared significantly ear-lier in the descending colon and rectosigmoidcolon than in the saline-treated patients. Al-though the mean time to postoperative defecationoccurred 17 hours earlier in the lidocaine-treated
group, this was not found to be statistically sig-
nificant, as was time to first passage of flatus. Inanother study, time until tolerating solid foodsalso occurred significantly earlier in lidocaine-treated patients.
[18]In this same study, Herroeder
and colleagues[18]reported gastrointestinal ato-
nia, defined as postoperative ileus for >5 days, in
eight patients in the control group compared withtwo patients in the lidocaine group. In the studyTable I. Contd

by Koppert et al.,[16]bowel movement occurred
6 hours earlier with lidocaine, but the difference
was not statistically significant compared withthe control group (table II).
Five studies reported on length of hospital
stay.
[15-19]In three studies, patients in the lido-
caine group were discharged home significantlyearlier than their control counterparts. Time tohospital discharge was an average of 1.1 daysshorter in the lidocaine-treated groups amongstthe three studies.
[15,18,19]Although duration of
hospital stay was 1.4 days shorter in the lido-caine-treated group in the study by Koppertet al.,
[16]this was not found to be statistically
significant when compared with the controlgroup (table II).
One study reported data on volatile agent use
and supplemental intraoperative opioid use. End-tidal desflurane concentrations were reduced by18%in the intravenous lidocaine group when
compared with controls. Fentanyl supplementa-tion was needed in 85 %of patients in the control
group as compared with only 5 %in the in-
travenous lidocaine group. Total intraoperativefentanyl use was reduced by 39 %in the in-
travenous lidocaine group when compared withplacebo.
[17]
2.1.2 Laparoscopic Surgery
Lidocaine regimens in patients undergoing
laparoscopic surgeries ranged from an infusion of3m g/kg/hour starting before surgery without a
bolus,
[21]to an intravenous bolus of 1.5 mg /kg
followed by an infusion of 2 mg /kg/hour[22-24]
until the end of surgery[21,23,24]or for 24 hours
postoperatively (table I).[22]
Two of four trials involving laparoscopic sur-
gery reported a significant reduction in painscores.
[21,22]In the study by Kaba et al.[22]in
patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy, alidocaine infusion maintained for 24 hours post-operatively was more effective in reducing painduring mobilization and when coughing thanat rest for 0 –24 hours. Abdominal discomfort
was also significantly reduced by lidocaine com-pared with the placebo group.
[22]In laparoscopic
prostatectomy patients who received a lidocaineinfusion intraoperatively and for 24 hours post-operatively, there was no difference in VAS painscores from 0 to 72 hours.
[23]Of the two trials in
laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients, one re-ported better pain control with lidocaine duringcough up to 24 hours after surgery, and at rest forup to 12 hours.
[21]However, the other study
showed no significant difference in pain intensitybetween the groups from 0 to 24 hours post-operatively,
[24]although lidocaine infusion was
discontinued at the end of surgery in both studies(table I).
Three of four studies in patients undergoing
laparoscopic surgery reported a significant reduc-tion in postoperative analgesic requirements.
[21,22,24]
In laparoscopic colectomy patients, lidocaine in-fusion was maintained for 24 hours after surgeryand resulted in >50%reduction in piritramide
consumption from 0 to 24 hours.
[22]In the two
studies in patients undergoing laparoscopic chole-cystectomy, the lidocaine infusion was termi-nated at the end of surgery. In the first study,fentanyl requirements in the lidocaine group werereduced by 36 %compared with the placebo
group from 0 to 3 hours postoperatively but therewas no difference at 24 hours.
[24]The other study
by Wu et al.[21]reported a 42 %reduction in
pethidine (meperidine) requirements from 0 to48 hours postoperatively. In the most recent stu-
dy by Lauwick et al.
[23]in patients undergoing
laparoscopic prostatectomy, lidocaine infusion
started after surgery and maintained for 24 hoursresulted in no difference in morphine consump-tion on postoperative day 1, with a trend towardless morphine consumption in the lidocainegroup on postoperative day 2 (table I).
Three of four studies reported data on return
of bowel function after laparoscopic abdominalsurgery.
[21-23]In patients undergoing laparosco-
pic colectomy, return of first flatus was 12 hours
earlier and return of defecation was 24 hours
earlier in patients treated with lidocaine. Lidocaine-treated patients were able to tolerate a normaldiet the day after surgery, whereas three patientsin the control group required prolongation ofpostoperative fasting.

postoperative ileus was significantly shorter with
a continuous intravenous lidocaine infusionthan with placebo (WMD -8.36 [95 %CI-13.24,
-3.47] hours). A subgroup analysis was con-ducted to explore the effects of intravenouslidocaine on postoperative gut dysfunction in
different surgical populations. Lidocaine de-
creased the duration of ileus significantly in thecholecystectomy subgroup (WMD -1.23 [95 %CI
-2.12, -0.34] hours), which included both open
and laparoscopic surgeries. Similarly, lidocainewas associated with a decrease in duration of ileusafter colonic resection (WMD -12.00 [95 %CI
-14.86, -9.13] hours), which also included both
open and laparoscopic surgeries. Lidocaine alsodecreased postoperative ileus in patients in whomlaparoscopy was performed (WMD -1.06 [95 %
CI-2.00, -0.13] hours).
[29]
A meta-analysis of five RCTs including 220
patients undergoing open or laparoscopicabdominal surgery showed a shorter length ofhospital stay in patients receiving lidocaine thanin controls (WMD -0.84 [95 %CI-1.38, -0.31]
days).
[29]
2.2 Orthopaedic Surgery
In one study in patients undergoing total hip
arthroplasty, lidocaine was given as an initial in-travenous bolus dose of 1.5 mg /kg after induction
of anaesthesia followed by an infusion at1.5 mg /kg/hour up to 1 hour postoperatively
(table I). There was no significant reduction inpain scores with lidocaine at rest or duringmovement at 24 hours, 48 hours and 3 months,nor did lidocaine infusion result in any reductionin postoperative analgesic requirements or dura-tion of hospital stay (table I).
[25]
2.3 Cardiac Surgery
For coronary artery bypass surgery, lidocaine
was given as an initial intravenous bolus dose of1.5 mg /kg after induction of anaesthesia followed
by an infusion of 30 mg/kg/minute for up to 48
hours postoperatively (table I). Lidocaine infu-sion did not result in any significant reduction in
VAS pain scores, postoperative fentanyl require-ment, time to discharge from ICU or length of
hospital stay.
[26]
2.4 Tonsillectomy
In one study in patients undergoing tonsil-
lectomy, lidocaine was given as an initialbolus dose of 1.5 mg /kg 30 minutes before
the beginning of surgery followed by an infu-sion at 2 mg /kg/hour for 6 hours and then
0.5 mg /kg/hour for an additional 18 hours. Lido-
caine infusion did not result in any significantreduction in VAS scores or postoperative an-algesic requirements (table I).
[27]
2.5 Ambulatory Surgery
The study by McKay et al.[28]involved a vari-
ety of ambulatory procedures, including lap-aroscopic general, open general, endocrine,breast, laparoscopic gynaecology, minor gynae-cology, urology, plastics, minor orthopaedic, andminor ear, nose and throat surgeries. Lidocainewas given as an initial intravenous bolus dose of1.5 mg /kg after induction of anaesthesia followed
by an infusion of 2 mg /kg/hour until 1 hour after
arrival in the PACU.
[28]VAS pain scores were
significantly lower at rest in the PACU in the li-docaine group, but no difference was found inVAS scores at 24 hours.
[28]In patients receiving
lidocaine a 50 %reduction in morphine require-
ment was demonstrated in the PACU, but nodifference in opioid consumption was found afterdischarge from the PACU.
[28]In addition, there
was no difference in PACU stay between patientswho received lidocaine and those who receivedplacebo (table I).
[28]
2.6 Adverse Effects
PONV was evaluated in eight studies involv-
ing both open and laparoscopic abdominalsurgery.
[13,14,16,17,21-24]No statistically signifi-
cant difference in the incidence of PONV wasfound between groups in seven of the eight stu-dies.
[13,14,16,21-24]A meta-analysis of five RCTs
involving abdominal surgery including 170 patientsreported an incidence of PONV of 32 %in the1158 McCarthy et al.
ª2010 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved. Drugs 2010; 70 (9)
lidocaine group and 52 %in the control group
(odds ratio 0.39 [95 %CI 0.20, 0.76]).[29]
Two trials evaluated sedation during the
postoperative period after open abdominal sur-
gery, but found no statistically significant differ-ence between groups.
[14,16]In patients following
coronary artery bypass grafting, although theoverall sedation score did not differ significantlybetween the two groups, the lidocaine group didhave a significantly higher score during the first4 hours postoperatively. This effect did not con-tinue into the later postoperative period eventhough the infusion was continued for up to48 hours.
[26]
In one study, one patient in the lidocaine
group developed an occasional arrhythmia withstable vital signs during laparoscopic cholecys-
tectomy.
[21]Occasional intraoperative brady-
cardia with stable haemodynamics occurred in
three of 20 patients in the intravenous lidocainegroup in the study by Kuo et al.,
[17]with no si-
milar occurrences in the control or epidurallidocaine groups.
2.7 Plasma Lidocaine Concentrations
Seven studies reported data on plasma lido-
caine concentrations.[13,16,18,22,25-27]Plasma lido-
caine concentrations were measured after bolusinjection and at different time intervals dur-ing and after infusion. Toxic concentrations(>5mg/mL) were not reached in any study fol-
lowing lidocaine infusion, with the exception ofone asymptomatic patient presenting with a peakvalue of 5.8 mg/mL measured 5 minutes after
lidocaine bolus in one study.
[18]Mean plasma
lidocaine concentrations ranged from 0.58 to
5mg/mL.[3,16,18,22,25-27]The highest plasma lido-
caine concentration at 24 hours was 4.6 mg/mL
after infusion of 1.33 mg/kg/hour for 24 hours.[22]
Plasma concentrations ranged between 2 and
5mg/mL when infused for 48 hours at a rate
of 30 mg/kg/minute.[26]In the study by Cassuto
et al.,[13]where lidocaine was given as a 100 mg
bolus followed by infusion of 2 mg /minute for
24 hours postoperatively, whole blood lidocaineconcentrations averaged 1.52 mg/mL 8 hours after
the start of infusion and 1.75 mg/mL at 20 hours.2.8 Plasma Levels of Cytokines and Integrins
Three studies measured the plasma levels of
cytokines.[17,18,20]Systemic lidocaine significantly
attenuated plasma levels of complement andproinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin
(IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-
1RA) at the end of surgery up to 72 hours post-operatively.
[17,18]In one study, the levels of IL-6,
IL-8 and IL-1RA returned to near baseline in allpatients by 24 hours.
[17]In another study, there
were still significant differences in IL-6 and IL-8levels between groups on postoperative day 3, butno significant difference in IL-1RA.
[18]A more
recent study found significant differences in IL-6at 72 hours but no significant difference in IL-1RA after 24 hours.
[20]Lidocaine also blunted
increases in integrin (CD11b) and selectin
(CD62L and CD62P) expression at the surface of
leukocytes and platelet-leukocyte aggregatesmeasured at the end of surgery and 2 hours and3 days postoperatively.
[18]
3. Discussion
This review shows that a perioperative in-
travenous infusion of lidocaine had a useful an-
algesic effect in patients undergoing abdominalsurgery. Its administration facilitated early re-covery and resulted in faster return of bowelfunction and a shorter duration of hospital stay.However, these benefits were not seen in patientsundergoing orthopaedic surgery, cardiac surgeryor tonsillectomy.
Lidocaine is an amide local anaesthetic that
has many pharmacological properties. Its anti-arrhythmic properties were first described in
the 1950s. Since then, it has become a widely
used agent for the treatment of cardiac ar-rhythmias.
[30]Since the 1960s, intravenous lido-
caine has been used to provide symptomatic relieffrom cancer pain,
[31]diabetic neuropathies[32,33]
and chronic pain,[34,35]without producing toxic
side effects or significant cardiovascular changes.Two mechanisms have been investigated toexplain the analgesic efficacy of lidocaine: a se-lective depression of pain transmission in thespinal cord
[34,35]and a reduction in tonic neuralIntravenous Lidocaine and Recovery from Surgery 1159
ª2010 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved. Drugs 2010; 70 (9)
discharge of active peripheral nerve fibres.[36,37]
The peripheral nerve fibres mediating pain are
A-dand C-fibres, and these appear uniquely
sensitive to the effects of lidocaine without threatof toxicity or disturbance in haemodynamics.
[35]
Intravenous lidocaine infusion had no bene-
ficial effect on postoperative pain in total hip ar-throplasty,
[25]coronary artery bypass surgery[26]
or tonsillectomy.[27]The investigators in the
orthopaedic study relate the lack of effect to thelow dose of lidocaine infused (1.5 mg /kg/hour)
and, consequently, the low mean plasma con-centration achieved of 2.1 mg/mL. This is in con-
trast to other studies where lidocaine was shownto be effective, which used similar doses and ob-tained mean plasma concentrations ranging from1.75 to 2.7 mg/mL.
[13,16,22]Tanelian and Mac-
Iver[35]have established that the clinically effec-
tive pain-relieving serum lidocaine concentrationthat is sufficient to reduce tonic injury dischargein both A- dand C-fibres is 2 –10mg/mL. Although
mean plasma lidocaine concentrations in the studyby Martin et al.
[25]were between adequate bounds,
the analgesic properties of lidocaine seemed todepend on the dose infused. Animal studies haveshown that small doses of lidocaine suppress ec-topic impulse generation in chronically injuredperipheral nerves, whereas moderate doses sup-
press central sensitization and central neuronal
hyperexcitability. Large doses have general an-algesic effect but induce systemic toxicity.
[38]The
study by Koppert et al.,[16]which utilized a similar
dose and duration of lidocaine infusion as thestudy by Martin et al.,
[25]reported a significant
reduction in analgesic requirement and pain scoreswith movement for up to 72 hours postoperatively.
In seven of the 12 abdominal studies, as well as
in the study on a range of ambulatory surgerypatients, intravenous lidocaine had a favourable
effect on postoperative pain.
[13,15-17,20-22,28]This
is consistent with the ability of lidocaine to alle-
viate visceral pain in animal models. It was shownthat intravenous lidocaine had inhibitory effectson visceromotor and cardiovascular reflexes, aswell as on the evoked and spontaneous activity ofneurons excited by colorectal distension, sug-gesting that sodium channel antagonists mayhave a role in the treatment of visceral pain.
[39]Lidocaine regimens varied amongst the studies
included in this review. The goal of intravenouslidocaine infusion is to achieve therapeutic stea-dy-state concentrations while avoiding systemictoxicity. The half-life of lidocaine has been re-ported to be about 100 minutes following bolus
injection or infusions lasting less than 12 hours,
showing more linear pharmacokinetics.
[40]The
short half-life of infusions lasting less than 12hours may explain the greater reduction in VASpain scores in the earlier postoperative period inthe studies by McKay et al.,
[28]Yardeni et al.,[20]
Kuo et al.[17]and Wu et al.,[21]in which lidocaine
infusion was discontinued at the end of surgery or1 hour postoperatively.
Following prolonged intravenous infusions,
lidocaine exhibits time-dependent, or nonlinear,
pharmacokinetics. In patients receiving pro-
longed lidocaine infusions after myocardial in-farction, lidocaine concentrations continued torise for about 48 hours and the half-life was pro-longed up to 4 hours.
[41]Although the results of
some of the studies included in this review pointtowards a greater analgesic effect of increasingthe duration of lidocaine infusion rather than thedose of lidocaine, the study by Koppert et al.
[16]
that utilized a lower dose of lidocaine infusion forup to just 1 hour postoperatively showed pro-
longed positive results lasting up to 72 hours.
With the exception of the study by Wu et al.,
[21]
the studies that reported lower pain scores and
decreased postoperative analgesic requirementused bolus dosing prior to infusion of intra-venous lidocaine.
[13,15-17,20,22,24,28,38]Since this
technique increases plasma concentrations to atherapeutic range more quickly, the majorityof studies in this review chose to use a bolus doseof 100 mg or 1.5 –2m g/kg. No ideal regimen for
lidocaine therapy has been determined, though
Aps et al.
[42]have suggested that a suitable
regimen would be a single injection (over 2 min-
utes) of 50 –100 mg followed by an infusion of
4m g/minute for 30 minutes, 2 mg /minute for
2 hours and then 1 mg /minute. This regimen avoids
the dip in concentrations to below the therapeuticrange that occurs 1 –3 hours after a single loading
dose
[42]but is more labour intensive. However,
this regimen was developed in patients who had1160 McCarthy et al.
ª2010 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved. Drugs 2010; 70 (9)
had a recent myocardial infarction and might not
be applicable in the perioperative period.
Weight-based dosing of lidocaine takes into
account its high hepatic extraction ratio. Plasmaclearance of lidocaine is about 10 mL /kg/minute
in patients with relatively normal hepatic blood
flow and function. To achieve steady-state con-
centrations of 3 mg/mL, an infusion rate of
30mg/kg/minute
[43]or 1.8 mg /kg/hour would be
required. The weight-based lidocaine regimensused in the studies reviewed, which ranged from1.33 to 3 mg /kg/hour, should have achieved ade-
quate plasma concentrations in the range of2–5mg/mL. However, adequate plasma concen-
trations did not always correlate with analgesicbenefit. The relationship between the dose of li-docaine used, duration of infusion and post-
operative analgesic effect is therefore not clear
and warrants further investigation.
The lack of a statistically significant analgesic
effect in some of the included studies might havebeen due to the small sample size used.
[19,23]The
use of co-analgesics may also explain the non-significant differences in VAS pain score andanalgesic requirement in several of the studies inthis review.
[18,23]The study by Herroeder et al.,[18]
for instance, administered dipyrone (metamizole)or paracetamol (acetaminophen) every 6 hours
postoperatively as a co-analgesic, while the
patients in the study by Lauwick et al.
[23]all re-
ceived paracetamol every 6 hours and naproxenevery 12 hours for the first 72 hours.
Intravenous lidocaine significantly accelerated
the return of bowel function. Gastrointestinaldysfunction after abdominal surgery is multi-factorial. The most commonly accepted patho-physiological features of postoperative ileus issurgically induced abdominal pain, which acti-vates a spinal reflex arc, and sympathetic hyper-
activity, which inhibits intestinal motility and
propulsive activity. Paravertebral reflexes relayedthrough the prevertebral ganglia might also playa role in postoperative ileus.
[44]Other important
causes include the inflammatory response toabdominal surgery, administration of anaes-thetics and opioids, and gastrointestinal hormonedisruption.
[45]The stimulatory actions of lido-
caine on postoperative colonic motility could bedue to blockade of the afferent and /or efferent
link of the sympathetic inhibitory spinal andprevertebral reflexes.
[46,47]The urinary output of
catecholamines has been shown to be reducedduring the second postoperative day with lido-caine infusion, suggesting a more rapid decline in
the postoperative sympathoadrenal response
with lidocaine.
[48]Intravenous lidocaine may
shorten the duration of ileus by reducing opioidconsumption, as reported in seven of the 12abdominal surgery trials.
[13-15,17,21,22,24]
Lidocaine also has significant anti-inflamma-
tory properties[4]and was shown to decrease
cytokine release both in vitro and in vivo by in-
hibiting neutrophil activation.[49-51]The three
studies included in this review that measuredplasma cytokine levels showed that intravenous
lidocaine attenuated the production of in-
flammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8 andIL-1RA. The lowest cytokine response wasassociated with the best bowel function.
[17,18]The
inflammatory cytokine IL-6, the level of which isproportionate to the extent of tissue injury,
[52]
can induce peripheral and central nervous systemsensitization leading to hyperalgesia.
[53]The chemo-
kine IL-8 potentially recruits neutrophils andmonocytes into the inflammatory site, acceleratinginflammation.
[54]IL-8 is identified as the first en-
dogenous mediator for evoking hyperalgesia invol-ving the sympathetic nervous system.
[55]The study
by Kuo et al.[17]included in this review showed that
epidural and intravenous lidocaine suppressed theperioperative increase in IL-8 and provided effective
pain relief. IL-1RA is released with IL-1 b, signalling
the acute phase response, which correlates well withthe grade of inflammation.
[56]
Intravenous lidocaine did not have an impact
on length of hospital stay in orthopaedic or cor-onary artery bypass surgery.
[25,26]However, in the
abdominal surgeries, intravenous lidocaine de-creased the length of hospital stay in three studiesby an average of 1.1 days.
[15,18,22]This was mainly
due to earlier return of bowel function. This hasan important impact on hospital costs. In 2002,the annual cost of postoperative ileus was esti-mated at $US1.46 billion.
[57]In one study,[58]re-
ducing hospital stay from 8 to 5 days resulted in a32%decrease in hospital costs per patient.Intravenous Lidocaine and Recovery from Surgery 1161

4. Conclusions
Continuous infusion of perioperative lidocaine
has a clear advantage in patients undergoing
abdominal surgery as it provides significant painrelief, reduces postoperative opioid consumption,decreases opioid-induced nausea and vomiting,
and promotes faster return of bowel function,
allowing for a shorter hospital stay. However,these benefits were not demonstrated in patientsundergoing total hip arthroplasty, cardiac sur-gery or tonsillectomy. Further studies are needed
to assess the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine inother surgical populations. The optimum dose,timing and duration of infusion of lidocaine alsoneed to be established.
