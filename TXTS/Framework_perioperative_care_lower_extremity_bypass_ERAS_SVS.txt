Although each specialty    and geographic region may be unique, the common    foundational theme is to create a culture in which all    perioperative physicians, surgeons, nurses, and therapists    work together within a clinical pathway to apply    evidence-based practice in unison.    Vascular surgery patients, specifically patients with    peripheral artery disease (PAD), present unique challenges due to their advanced age, frailty, and multiple    comorbidities compared with the general population.    This combination of factors results in complex management strategies, increased utilization of health care resources, prolonged hospitalizations, and rehabilitation    needs.4 ERAS, with its aim of delivering high-quality    perioperative care and accelerating recovery, appears    well-suited to address the needs of patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass operations, but unfortunately,    there is not enough published data to support formal    ERAS guidelines. To reduce unwarranted clinical practice variation and to potentially enhance clinical care,    this document is a synthesis of the existing literature    for best practices and provides a framework for the    perioperative care of patients undergoing open surgical infrainguinal bypass. The paper also shows the    gaps in the literature and suggests areas where    research is needed for more robust knowledge to    improve the care for this patient group.    METHODS    Formation of the Guideline Development Group and    selection of topics. In collaboration, the Society for    Vascular Surgery and the ERAS Society initiated the formation of the multidisciplinary, international Guideline    Development Group (GDG), which consisted of vascular    surgeons, anesthesiologists, and advanced practice providers with expertise in ERAS and vascular pathophysiology. The GDG was consulted for advice on    appropriate items to be included, with the final decision    being made by the lead authors (KM and HDB). The    selected topics for the consensus statement were allocated to authors for literature summary depending on    each individual¡¦s expertise. The final content was agreed    upon by all authors.    Literature search strategy. A third-party team of investigators and a reference librarian specializing in literature reviews assisted the GDG in identifying and    categorizing the existing effectiveness and comparative    effectiveness literature on ERAS protocols relevant to    vascular surgery. The librarian executed and documented the search in July 2019 (Appendix 1). The    databases queried included PubMed, CINAHL, and    clinicaltrials.gov. Systematic reviews, randomized    controlled trials (RCTs), and observational cohort studies    reporting on adults ($18 years) undergoing lower extremity vascular surgery and reporting on any one or    combinations of the ERAS guideline items were    included. GDG members then searched reference lists    and repeated literature searches to include any new    publications through December 2021. Many ERAS items    had not been studied specifically in patients undergoing    2 McGinigle et al Journal of Vascular Surgery    --- 2023    infrainguinal bypass, so published data and ERAS    guidelines from other surgical specialties were included    for the elements that were generalizable. The included    studies were carefully reviewed by the GDG, who unanimously agreed upon them.    Quality assessment, data analyses, and consensus    generation. Suggestions for best perioperative practices    were made based on the supporting literature specific    to this patient population, and, at times, supporting literature extrapolated from other surgical populations.    Assessment of the quality of evidence was judged to    be high, moderate, or low. Where non-vascular literature was used as a primary basis for suggestions, the    quality of evidence was extrapolated to this population    and indicated in each section. Because of this, although    some of the practice suggestions are based from a highquality evidence base and are unlikely to change, other    suggestions are merely from expert consensus or lowquality evidence and may change if more rigorous    research is performed.    The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to    judge the literature, but formal recommendations using    the GRADE system were not made across all elements    due to lack of consistently high-quality data derived    from this specific patient population.5    RESULTS    The literature search yielded 3460 citations. There were    109 studies addressing ERAS interventions, as either individual core elements or combinations of elements, in    vascular surgery patients, and another 18 studies    included mixed cohorts, including vascular surgery patients. Most of these studies involved vascular patients    with abdominal aortic pathology, and only 45 involved    patients undergoing lower extremity vascular operations.    Structured around the 22 ERAS core elements, 26 suggestions for best perioperative practices were made    and organized into preadmission, preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative sections (Table).    PREADMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS    1. Patient information, education, and counseling    Preoperative education and counseling are cornerstones of ERAS pathways to engage patients and caregivers in all aspects of their perioperative care. It allows    setting and managing expectations regarding early    mobility, postoperative pain control, anticipated length    of stay (LOS), and follow-up.6,7 Although studies on lower    extremity bypass-specific education strategies are lacking, there is literature, including an RCT, from other general surgical specialties on use of extended pre- and    postoperative counseling, guidance by an ERAS nurse,    and written information leads to less pain, less nausea,    reduced time as an inpatient, and increased enhanced    recovery pathway adherence.8-10    Suggestion: Patients should receive dedicated verbal    and written preoperative education and counseling.    Quality of evidence: Low.    2. Assessment and optimization: (a) nutritional deficiency; (b) anemia screening; (c) frailty; (d) delirium risk;    (e) psychosocial concerns, and (f) tobacco and alcohol    overconsumption    2a. Nutritional deficiency. Poor nutrition in patients    with PAD undergoing revascularization correlates with    worse outcomes, including increased mortality and    risk of major amputation.11-14 Poor nutrition also significantly impacts wound healing in patients with chronic    limb-threatening ischemia, a group that is particularly    high-risk for baseline malnutrition.13,15,16 Coupled to    these issues, limited mobility due to rest pain, tissue    loss, or prior contralateral amputation can induce a    decline in basal energy expenditure, reduced insulin    sensitivity, anabolic resistance to protein nutrition, and    muscle strength.17    Preoperative nutritional deficiency can be established    by screening.18 There are many nutritional screening    tools available, and only expert consensus regarding    the best; however, the European Society for Clinical    Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) suggests the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) be used in the    outpatient community setting, and Nutritional Risk    Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) for inpatients.18,19 These    guidelines have suggested specific parameters for severe    nutritional risk based on weight loss, body mass index,    and preoperative serum albumin concentration.    If one of these criteria is present, formal nutritional    assessment is needed, and targeted nutritional therapy    should be initiated.18,19 Oral nutritional supplements,    including those containing immunonutrients,20-22 are    almost always preferred to enteral or parenteral nutrition    regimens.18 Regimens for treating malnutrition via oral    nutritional supplementation have shown greatest effect    if started at least 7 to 10 days preoperatively in nonvascular cohorts.23-26    Suggestion: Screen for malnutrition and treat nutritional deficiency preferably with oral regimens.    Quality of evidence: Moderate.    2b. Anemia screening. Preoperative anemia, is associated with poor outcomes after surgery and is common    in patients undergoing lower extremity arterial bypass.27-    30 Although blood transfusion can quickly correct    preoperative anemia, caution should be used, as transfusion is also associated with increased mortality and    morbidity.31,32 There are benefits to avoiding transfusion,    and it is recommended that patients who are at risk for    transfusion such as those with severe anemia or with    moderate to large volume blood loss (>500 mL) undergo    testing and treatment for anemia when possible.33    Journal of Vascular Surgery McGinigle et al 3    Volume -, Number -    Table.

Screening, assessment, and    optimization: glycemic control    All patients should have a baseline HbA1c level prior to    revascularization. In patients with elevated HbA1c levels, antihyperglycemic treatment should be initiated and/or titrated with    the assistance of a specialist.    High    3.

Pre-anesthetic sedative and    analgesia medication    i. Do not routinely use sedatives to reduce anxiety preoperatively.    ii. Routinely use preoperative administration of acetaminophen,    NSAIDs, and gabapentinoids as part of a multimodal opioidsparing analgesia strategy.    iii. For opioid-dependent patients, maintain outpatient pain    regimen in the perioperative period.    Lowa    Lowa    Moderatea    8. Antimicrobials i.

Prophylactic IV antibiotic dosing should begin 30 to 60 minutes    preoperatively with re-dosing intraoperatively for procedures    greater than 4 hours or with substantive intraoperative blood    loss and extend no more than 24 hours postoperatively.    Low    High    9. PONV Risk-assess for PONV, routinely use multimodal PONV prophylaxis    based on assessment, and use PONV rescue with a different class    of anti-emetic.    Higha    4 McGinigle et al Journal of Vascular Surgery    --- 2023    Laboratory testing may identify a correctable cause for    anemia (eg, iron deficiency). For example, in a large    multi-center series of patients undergoing major elective    surgery, including cardiac surgery, up to 60% of patients    with anemia had low iron stores.34 Subsequent treatment for iron deficiency can include either oral or intravenous routes, depending on the timeline to surgery,    and there is evidence from one RCT and a pooled analysis of observational data from over 2500 patients to support that some patient populations may benefit from    correction of iron deficiency, even with short courses of    treatment.35,36 Even though correction of anemia may    reduce the need for transfusion, there is little evidence    to support that it impacts overall morbidity and mortality, and there are no large studies to date to examine    the effects in a vascular surgery-specific population.35,37-41    Caution is advised in translating certain anemia therapies to lower extremity revascularization amid presence    of the United States Food and Drug Administration¡¦s limitations of use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents in patients undergoing cardiac or vascular surgery, and an    adverse event profile that includes thrombotic events.42    Use of intraoperative interventions, such as minimally    invasive techniques and/or cell salvage for complex cases    anticipated to have long operative time, may also be    considered in order to reduce the need for perioperative    transfusion, particularly in patients with pre-existing    anemia.43,44    Suggestion: Evaluate the cause of and treat chronic    preoperative anemia.    Quality of Evidence: Low.    2c. Frailty. Frailty is a syndrome of diminished physiological reserve that predisposes patients to adverse    health outcomes, especially in the presence of a stressor.    Although frailty and aging are not the same, frailty is    associated with aging and with the presence of PAD.    Table.

Based on observational    data related to shared decision-making and/or prehabilitation experience from other cardiovascular conditions    like aortic and carotid disease, these interventions seem    advisable50; however, currently there are no published    trials evaluating this for patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass.51 Ultimately, variations in disease severity at    presentation may limit feasibility or time available to undergo rehabilitation interventions, although it should be    noted that even patients with ischemic wounds often do    not need urgent revascularization.52-54 In cases where urgent revascularization is required, the use of frailty    screening may still be utilized to guide shared decisionmaking, consideration of alternate treatments that may    still meet goals of care, or expectation setting around    outcomes and recovery challenges.    Suggestion: Screen for frailty as a routine part of preoperative patient assessment.    Quality of evidence: Moderate.    2d. Delirium risk. Delirium can contribute to adverse    events, prolonged hospital stays, non-home discharge    destinations, and mortality following vascular surgery.55,56 Delirium has been noted in medium- to largesize cohort studies utilizing validated delirium assessment scores to have incidences ranging from 5% to    29%57-63; rates as high as 42.3% have been identified in    sub-cohorts of patients with chronic limb-threatening    ischemia.64 Risk factors identified from meta-analysis    of observational studies include age, hypertension, diabetes, hearing impairment, history of transient ischemic    attack or cerebrovascular accident, renal failure, lower    preoperative hemoglobin, duration of surgery, emergent    surgery, and estimated blood loss, whereas regional    anesthesia was protective from development of postoperative delirium.55 A single moderate-sized prospective study of patients with chronic limb-threatening    ischemia undergoing surgical therapy also noted an association of poor nutritional status (Short Nutritional    Assessment Questionnaire for Residential Care [SNAQRC] $3) with delirium.56 Preoperative identification of    cognitive risk using standardized cognitive scales such as    the mini-mental state exam can also allow engagement    of patients/families to discuss implications of proposed    surgery, including the capacity to consent and risk of    postoperative complications including delirium and    brain health.49,65    Suggestion: Screen for delirium risk and implement    preoperative practices to minimize onset of delirium as    a routine part of practice.    Level of Evidence: Low.    2e. Psychosocial concerns. Anxiety, depression, and    lack of social support in particular are described risk factors in the course of recovery after surgery. A variety of    studies have demonstrated that psychosocial factors    play a significant role in recovery and are predictive of    surgical outcomes in patients with PAD.66,67 Estimates    of depression in PAD patients range from 11% to 48% in    cross-sectional studies and from 3% to 36% in longitudinal studies.68 Depression is associated with progressive    declines in walking ability, increased inflammation, and    increased risk of recurrent symptoms.69-71 A single-center    retrospective cohort study of 216 patients undergoing    infrainguinal revacularization found that patients with    depression have worse primary patency (hazard ratio,    1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-3.02; P ? .04) and    higher failure of revascularization (hazard ratio, 2.18; 95%    CI, 1.22-3.88; P < .01).70 Among Veterans with PAD, concurrent depression was associated with a 13% greater    major limb amputation and 17% greater mortality risk    compared with patients with PAD without depression.72    Patients who have a positive screening test should be    referred back to their primary care physician or to a    mental health specialist for formal diagnosis and    treatment.    Suggestion: Routinely screen for depression.    Quality of Evidence: Low.    2f.

Tobacco is a leading risk factor in the development of PAD and is associated with substantial short- and long-term morbidity    and mortality.73,74 In a cohort of 2913 patients from the    Vascular Quality Initiative registry undergoing infrainguinal bypass surgery, current smoking was associated    with almost 30% increased risk of major adverse limb    events at 1 year.75 In a multi-center retrospective review    of 693 patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass surgery    from 2013 to 2017, patients who smoked more than one    6 McGinigle et al Journal of Vascular Surgery    --- 2023    pack of cigarettes per day were at a 1.48-times increase in    the risk of major adverse limb events at 1 year compared    with patients who smoked less than one pack per day.76    In the perioperative period, nicotine replacement therapy and smoking cessation medications have proven    efficacy for smoking cessation, which is of critical    importance in this specific patient population.77,78    Further, a cluster-randomized trial of 156 current adult    smokers with PAD demonstrated feasibility of a brief    surgeon-delivered smoking cessation intervention    increasing interest in smoking cessation and is associated with declines in nicotine dependence at 3    months.79,80    In addition to limb-based outcomes, there is substantial published literature describing other benefits to preoperative smoking cessation. A systematic review and    meta-analysis of 25 studies (2 RCT, 7 prospective cohort    studies, and 16 retrospective studies) including over    20,000 cardiac and non-cardiac surgical patients, there    was a 23% and 47% reduction in respiratory complications in patients who stopped smoking 4 and 8 weeks    prior to surgery, respectively.81 Another meta-analysis of    four RCTs demonstrated smoking cessation interventions reduced surgical site infections, and pooled data    from 140 cohort studies supports 1 month of smoking    cessation being associated with improved post-surgical    outcomes.82,83    Suggestion: Prescribe smoking cessation therapy    before surgery.    Quality of evidence: High.    In two RCTs comprising 69 surgical patients, 1 month of    preoperative abstinence from alcohol improved outcomes in a patients who imbibed at least five alcohol    equivalents (or 15 units) per day.84 A Cochrane review of    these two studies describes postoperative morbidity is    increased by two- to three-fold in patients who abuse    alcohol, and another meta-analysis of multiple RCTs in    mixed surgical cohorts shows that daily drinking increases the risk of non-surgical site infection, but does    not increase postoperative mortality.85    Suggestion: Recommend alcohol cessation 4 weeks    prior to surgery.    Quality of Evidence: Low.    2h. Medical risk. Patients undergoing lower extremity    bypass surgery generally have multiple cardiovascular,    pulmonary, renal, and metabolic comorbidities that will    influence their medical risk, impact their perioperative    outcomes, and dictate a multidisciplinary approach to    preoperative evaluation and optimization. Medical preoperative assessment and optimization of each major    risk factor should be undertaken in accordance with    the most current clinical practice guidelines on perioperative evaluation, optimization, and management of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Risk scores may    be used to help stratify overall risk of surgery, and the    Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) mortality prediction    model for patients with chronic limb-threatening    ischemia performs well in American and European cohorts (C ? 0.86).86    Cardiac risk. Patients with PAD have a higher risk of    cardiovascular mortality than patients with coronary artery disease alone.87 Multiple cardiac risk calculators are    available; however, the model discrimination for predicting postoperative myocardial infarction after surgery    are not accurate at predicting postoperative outcomes,    meaning they are unlikely to be of benefit and thus are    not universally recommended.88-91 In clinical practice,    functional capacity or ability to perform metabolic    equivalents is a key determinant of preoperative assessment.92 Unfortunately, in patients with PAD and limited    mobility, standard measures of activity may not be able    to be used. Although poor capacity alone is only weakly    associated with impaired outcomes after lower extremity bypass surgery, cardiac and pulmonary prognosis is    good if functional capacity is high, even in the presence    of stable ischemic heart disease or other risk factors.93    Based on multiple RCTs and multi-society guidelines,    to mitigate cardiac risk, all patients with peripheral    vascular disease should be offered antiplatelet therapy    (81 mg ASA), high-intensity HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors even if the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)    cholesterol <100 mg/dL, and antihypertensives where    there is a persistent systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg,    unless contraindicated.92 The Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis (CARP) trial94 showed no survival    benefit with coronary revascularization before elective    vascular surgery, and another RCT95 of 430 patients with    high-risk cardiac stress tests showed no difference in    long-term outcomes in elective vascular surgery with    preoperative coronary revascularization. However, secondary analysis of the data from the CARP trial demonstrated that preoperative revascularization of left main    coronary artery stenoses ($50%) is associated with    improved survival after elective vascular surgery.96    Pulmonary risk. There is an association of lower extremity atherosclerotic occlusive disease with chronic    pulmonary disease due to its connection with current    and prior nicotine abuse. There is no high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of routine preoperative chest    radiography or pulmonary function tests in patients undergoing lower extremity bypass surgery.97 Patients    should only undergo these tests if they have new or unstable cardiopulmonary signs or symptoms, or if they are    believed to be at such an increased risk of pulmonary    complications that the results will alter management (ie,    inform decisions or postpone surgery).98-100    Suggestion: Evaluate and optimize comorbidities prior    to elective surgery and consider medical risks before urgent surgery.    Quality of evidence: High.    2i. Glycemic control. Over 20% of patients over 65 years    have impaired fasting glucose, and up to one-third of    Journal of Vascular Surgery McGinigle et al 7    Volume -, Number -    those patients do not carry a current diagnosis of    diabetes.101 Diabetes accelerates the progression of    atherosclerosis102-104 and is common in patients with    peripheral artery disease and chronic limb-threatening    ischemia.54,105 There are conflicting reports of whether    a diagnosis of diabetes alone adversely impacts    outcomes after revascularization106-110; however, there is    evidence to support that prolonged hyperglycemia as    evidenced by an elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is    associated with worse outcomes.102,111,112 Retrospective    analyses of patients undergoing revascularization with    abnormal HbA1c (>7%) found that incremental increases    in HbA1c is associated with increasing risk of overall    complications, adverse limb events, and major amputation, regardless of whether patients had a prior diagnosis    of diabetes.113,114 Complications were particularly significant in patients with very elevated HbA1c values of    >10%.114    Preoperative evaluation prior to lower extremity arterial    bypass should include baseline HbA1c measurement.115,116    Because prediabetes and diabetes are also frequently    undiagnosed, baseline HbA1c measurement should be    obtained regardless of a prior diagnosis of diabetes. For    patients with elevated HbA1c and no existing medical    care plan, referral to a specialist should be obtained.    For those already on anti-hyperglycemic medication    and an elevated HbA1c, particularly if it is >10%, there    may be some benefit to attempts to improve hyperglycemic control prior to surgery.114 Although there is no    strong evidence to support a specific preoperative    HbA1c level prior to revascularization in patients with    PAD, attempts to obtain strict control (HbA1c <6%), as    opposed to standard control (HbA1c, 7%-8%), in highrisk patients with diabetes was associated with worse    outcomes in a randomized control trial of 10,251 patients    with type 2 diabetes mellitus.117 Therefore, the preoperative goal should be relative improvement in hyperglycemia and must be weighed against the urgency of the    procedure.    Recommendations for preoperative management of    specific anti-hyperglycemic regimens in type 2 diabetics    varies based on the anticipated fasting time and invasiveness of the procedure.118 Although a feature of    enhanced recovery is reduced fasting time, given the    invasiveness of lower extremity arterial bypass, most    oral anti-hyperglycemic patients should be held the    day of surgery. This is particularly true for patients on    Metformin who will receive intravenous contrast exposure during the procedure. Depending on the specific insulin regimen, insulin doses should be continued as    prescribed or a slightly reduced (80%) dose the day prior    to surgery and then held or moderately reduced (50%)    the day of surgery.118    Suggestion: All patients should have a baseline HbA1c    level prior to revascularization. In patients with elevated    HbA1c levels, anti-hyperglycemic treatment should be    initiated and/or titrated with the assistance of a    specialist.    Quality of Evidence: High.    3. Perioperative antithrombotic strategy/plan    Based on an RCT and a prospective cohort study of over    1600 patients undergoing vascular surgery, aspirin reduces adverse cardiovascular events and mortality    among patients with coronary artery disease and should    be continued during the perioperative period.119-121 Often,    patients with coexistent coronary artery disease and PAD    are on dual anti-platelet therapy, and based on multiple    large observational studies of mixed surgical populations, the 2016 American College of Cardiology/American    Health Association Guidelines recommend avoiding    discontinuation of the second agent within 1 month after    bare metal and 6 months after drug-eluting coronary    stent placement.121-125 When feasible, any anti-platelet    medication other than aspirin must be stopped 7 days    prior to surgery to reduce the risk of regional anesthesia    techniques, and may be resumed 6 hours after block    performance or epidural catheter removal.126,127 Both    warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants should be discontinued at least 5 days and 2 days in advance of surgery,    respectively, to allow for regional anesthetic techniques    and to reduce the risk of intra-operative bleeding.128    Resuming antiplatelet and anticoagulation medications. Little evidence is available on timing of perioperative resumption or initiation of anticoagulation and    antiplatelet agents. The VOYAGER randomized control    trial required randomization to therapy within 10 days    post-procedure,129 and the CASPAR trial maintained    patients on aspirin and initiated clopidogrel in its therapy    arm within 2 to 4 days postoperatively,130 but published    results from most other trials lack timing of postoperative initiation and focus on long-term risks of therapies. As detailed in the Global Vascular Guidelines on    the Management of Chronic Limb-threatening Ischemia,    risks and benefits of long-term medication regimens vary    based on conduit type, disease stage, and the relative    threat to bypass patency anticipated from anatomic and    operative factors.54    In a Cochrane Review and meta-analysis of 16 studies    with 5683 randomized patients, antiplatelet therapy    had a beneficial effect on primary patency of bypass    grafts compared with placebo or no therapy.131 For vein    bypasses, aspirin or dipyridamole monotherapy showed    significant benefit in meta-analysis to primary graft    patency only at 1 year (but not significant benefit at 1,3,    6, or 24 months); in contrast, significant primary patency    benefit was seen at all time points up through 1 year for    prosthetic conduit bypasses. In the CASPAR trial,    randomizing dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel vs aspirin and placebo for below-knee popliteal    bypasses, vein bypasses did not have a patency benefit,    whereas a significant benefit was observed in prosthetic    8 McGinigle et al Journal of Vascular Surgery    --- 2023    bypasses over median follow-up of just under 1 year.130    An increase in bleeding events with dual antiplatelet    therapy was seen for venous grafts but not prosthetic    grafts.131    Differential benefits of postoperative anticoagulant    therapy have been noted for venous bypasses and prosthetic bypasses in moderate-sized RCTs.132,133 In metaanalysis of vitamin K antagonists therapy compared    with no anticoagulant therapy, a significant protective    benefit from occlusion was only seen at 6 months, but    not at 3 months, or 1, 2, or 5 years in venous bypasses    and only at a late interval (5 years) after prosthetic bypasses.134 In venous bypasses at all time points from 3    to 24 months, vitamin K antagonists were protective    against occlusion compared with aspirin or dipyridamole.134 However, major hemorrhagic events occurred    more frequently among patients undergoing femoropopliteal bypass receiving warfarin plus aspirin vs aspirin    alone.135 In a small RTC, postoperative hematoma was    greater among those receiving warfarin and ASA    compared with ASA alone, but no differences were    noted between the groups in the number of packed    red blood cells transfused, or in the incidence rate of    overall non-hemorrhagic wound complications, or the    overall complication rate.136 The combination of warfarin    plus aspirin therapy appears to protect from occlusion in    smaller diameter prosthetic bypasses133 and from severe    ischemia in femoropopliteal PTFE grafts when occlusion    occurs.137    Prospective randomized evidence to date around use    of novel oral anticoagulant agents following lower extremity bypass revascularization comes primarily from    the VOYAGER PAD trial,129 which randomized initiation    of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily dosing vs placebo in    addition to background antiplatelet therapy; of note, clopidogrel as an adjunct to study antithrombotic regimen    could be administered for up to 60 days after a lower extremity revascularization at the discretion of the investigator.138,139 Among the 2185 patients who underwent    surgical lower extremity intervention (lower extremity    bypass, endarterectomy, or both), a benefit was seen    with rivaroxaban in prevention of acute limb ischemia    events.138 The median time from revascularization to    study drug initiation among the surgical revascularizations was 6 days, and bleeding risk of rivaroxaban    appeared to be consistent between those initiated on    medication therapy less than 6 days from surgery vs 6    or more days from surgery. Bleeding events requiring    an unplanned take-back procedure remained low    (1.3%) and did not differ between rivaroxaban vs placebo    therapies; similarly, in the long term, by 3 years, the cumulative incidence of major bleeding did not differ between rivaroxaban vs placebo within the surgical    bypasses.138    Suggestion: Continue aspirin throughout the perioperative period.    Level of evidence: High.    Suggestion: Consider adjunctive anticoagulation therapy in prosthetic or high-risk bypasses.    Level of evidence: Moderate.    PREOPERATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS    4. Fasting. Based on meta-analysis of multiple RCTs in a    range of surgical patients and according to both the    American Society of Anesthesiologists¡¦ and European    Society of Anesthesiology¡¦s preoperative fasting guidelines that give a strong recommendation based on highquality evidence, patients should be allowed to drink    clear fluids up to 2 hours before elective surgery, but    should not eat any solid food for at least 6 hours for ¡§light    meals¡¨ or 8 hours for fatty foods and meat.140,141 It is    important to note that these recommendations apply to    patients who undergo elective procedures, and a longer    fasting period may be necessary in patients with risk    factors for delayed gastric emptying such as obesity,    diabetes, hiatal hernia, and gastroesophageal reflux    disease.    Suggestion: Avoid overnight fasting; encourage clear    fluids up to 2 hours and light foods up to 6 hours prior    to the induction of general anesthesia.    Level of evidence: High.    5. Carbohydrate loading. Although the effectiveness of    carbohydrate loading has not been fully established in    patients undergoing vascular surgery, several RCTs in    other surgical populations demonstrate a preoperative    carbohydrate drink compared with placebo or fasting    after midnight reduce insulin resistance and lessen the    risk of hyperglycemia after surgery.142-148 The most    commonly studied preoperative carbohydrate regimen    is 800 mL of a clear 12.5% carbohydrate drink the evening before surgery and 400 mL up to 2 hours before    surgery.144-148 A systematic review of 22 RCTs found that    oral carbohydrate loading is safe up to 2 hours prior to    surgery and can improve postoperative discomfort,149    and a Cochrane Review of 27 RCTs of variable quality in    mixed surgical populations conclude that preoperative    carbohydrate loading reduces hospital length of stay.150    As many patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass have    diabetes, the question of effectiveness and safety has    been raised. It has been suggested that carbohydrate    drink alternatives such as popular sports drinks may be    more appropriate for patients with a diagnosis of diabetes; however, the evidence to support this practice is    low.7 Despite low quality evidence, it appears that oral    carbohydrates are safe and effective in well-controlled    diabetic patients, without a significant risk of hyperglycemia or aspiration.151,152    Suggestion: Patients without diabetes should receive a    preoperative carbohydrate drink.    Level of evidence: High.    Journal of Vascular Surgery McGinigle et al 9    Volume -, Number -    Suggestion: Patients with well-controlled diabetes    should receive a preoperative carbohydrate drink.    Level of evidence: Low.    6. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. VTE risk can    be significantly reduced by incorporating multiple strategies such as early mobility, mechanical prophylaxis, and    chemoprophylaxis. Compiling data from over 100 RCTs    of mixed populations comparing low-dose unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and no    chemoprophylaxis, the American College of Chest Physicians Guidelines on the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in nonorthopedic surgical patients    notes that there is significant reduction in VTE when    prophylactic doses of either of these anticoagulants are    used and that bleeding complications are rare.153    The use of mechanical prophylaxis should be employed    along with chemoprophylaxis or alone in patients who    have a high risk of bleeding. Mechanical prophylaxis decreases the risk for postoperative VTE by preventing    venous stasis and reducing plasminogen activator    inhibitor-1, increasing endogenous fibrinolytic activity.    Mechanical compression stockings should be avoided in    patients with severe arterial disease despite intervention    (systolic ankle pressure <60 mmHg; toe pressure    <30 mmHg).154 Intermittent pneumatic compression    and venous foot pumps are not contraindicated in patients who have had infrainguinal bypass surgery, but mechanical prophylaxis should be avoided in patients with in    situ bypasses, tibial bypass, or any other instance the    compression device would place direct pressure on the    conduit.155    Suggestion: Routinely use either low-dose unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin with    calf-length intermittent compression devices, when    possible, starting either prior to surgery or within 24    hours of surgery end, and continuing throughout the    hospitalization.    Quality of literature: High.    7. Pre-anesthetic sedative and analgesia medication.    Preoperative anxiety is frequent and may lead to    increased perioperative analgesic requirements. Multiple    prospective and retrospective cohort studies demonstrate benzodiazepines can cause neurocognitive    impairment and have unwanted sedative effects156-159;    therefore, sedative or anxiolytic drugs should be avoided.    This is particularly important in patients over 65 years old,    as the American Geriatric Society has made a strong    recommendation, with moderate evidence, against the    use of benzodiazepines in older adults.157    Patients with PAD often have pre-existing chronic    pain, due to ischemic rest pain and/or tissue loss,    which are key features of this disease.160 Perioperative    pain management may be complicated by established analgesic regimens as well as advanced age    and pre-existing comorbidities including renal    impairment.161 Dosed appropriately for age and renal    function, multimodal opioid-sparing perioperative    analgesia includes acetaminophen, non-steroidal    anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and gabapentinoids, all of which have been shown to decrease    postoperative pain scores, facilitate opioid sparing    pain management, and can be administered in a    cost-effective manner.159,162    Patients who are currently using analgesics for    chronic pain could benefit from an interdisciplinary    approach and should have expectations set for postoperative pain management before the operation occurs.    Abruptly stopping the patient¡¦s baseline opioid medication can result in inadequate postoperative pain control and increased risk of acute withdrawal in the    postoperative period, and this is not recommended.163    This is particularly true for patients taking    methadone.164    For patients on buprenorphine (especially >12 mg/day),    even dose decreases can cause withdrawal, and patients    will need their pain specialist to gradually reduce the    dose prior to any operation in which postoperative opioids will be used.165    Notably, revascularization may improve chronic    ischemic pain, and outpatient tapers of all types of analgesics may be possible.    Suggestion: Do not routinely use sedatives to reduce    anxiety preoperatively.    Level of evidence: Low.    Suggestion: Routinely use preoperative administration    of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and gabapentinoids as part    of a multimodal opioid-sparing analgesia strategy.    Level of evidence: Low.    Suggestion: Continue existing preoperative pain regimens with minimal disruption.    Level of evidence: Moderate.    8. Antimicrobial prophylaxis and skin preparation to    reduce surgical site infections. Surgical site infections    (SSIs) can involve superficial or deep incisional tissues,    and are typically caused by typical skin flora, although    vascular surgical wounds and/or ischemic wounds can    have a variety of organisms.166 A bundled program to    prevent the development of SSI is often recommended    and may reduce SSI by 51% in a single-center observational study.167 Specifically included in most bundles are    perioperative normothermia, appropriate skin preparation and hair removal, preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, and minimizing traffic in and out of the operating    room.168 Adjunctive use of antibiotics such as triclosancoated suture or gentamicin-impregnated grafts have    mixed results and have not been shown to consistently    reduce SSIs.169,170    Skin preparation should be standardized, with the    operative area being scrubbed on the day prior to and    10 McGinigle et al Journal of Vascular Surgery    --- 2023    immediately before surgery with a Chlorhexidine    solution based on RCTs of heterogeneous cleancontaminated surgeries indicating benefit, though    smaller RCTs and prospective observational studies of    vascular reconstructions have not demonstrated    benefit.171-173 Based on meta-analysis of a small number    of RCTs with heterogeneous surgical procedures and    quasi-experimental cohort studies of vascular surgeries,    hair clipping should be performed immediately preoperatively, with hair clipping preferred to shaving.167,174,175    Preoperative intravenous prophylactic antibiotics    should be administered immediately prior to lower extremity bypass based on meta-analysis of RCTs.176 Antibiotic duration has been primarily evaluated in patients    without pre-existing infectious sources; in lower extremity bypass procedures with non-infected tissue, prophylactic antibiotics did not convey significant additional    benefit when continued more than 24 hours postoperatively.176 Extrapolated from cardiac and spine surgery,    intraoperative antibiotic should be re-dosed within two    serum half-lives of the agent177-179 and may be additionally recommended for substantive procedural blood    loss.180    Suggestion: Consider the use of bundles programs to    reduce SSIs.    Quality of Evidence: Low.    Suggestion: Prophylactic intravenous antibiotic dosing    should begin 30 to 60 minutes preoperatively with    redosing intraoperatively within two serum half-lives of    antimicrobial agent used or with substantive intraoperative blood loss, and extending no more than 24 hours    postoperatively.    Quality of evidence: High.    9. Prevention of nausea and vomiting. Postoperative    nausea and vomiting (PONV) is estimated to be 50%    and 30% in the general surgical population, respectively,    and may approach 80% in patients who are high risk for    PONV.181 The most commonly used PONV risk scoring    systems are the Koivuranta and Apfel scores.182,183 It is    important to employ PONV mitigation strategies, such as    minimizing the use of nitrous oxide and volatile anesthetics,184 utilizing regional anesthesia such as peripheral    nerve blocks and neuraxial anesthesia,185 and including    opioid-sparing, multimodal analgesia techniques.186,187    There is significant high quality evidence from multiple    RCTs supporting the use of multimodal prophylaxis and    treatment of PONV that can be generalized to major    vascular surgery.188 Pharmacologic agent classes and    other interventions that are currently available include    5-HT3 receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, antihistamines, dopamine antagonists, propofol anesthesia, NK-1    receptor antagonists, anticholinergics, and acupuncture.189 For rescue treatment, one should use an antiemetic from different class than what was used for    prophylaxis.    Suggestion: Risk assess for PONV, routinely use multimodal PONV prophylaxis based on assessment, and    use PONV rescue with a different class of anti-emetic.    Quality of evidence: High.    INTRAOPERATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS    10. Anesthetic protocol    Patients undergoing peripheral vascular procedures    often have widespread atherosclerotic disease and suffer    significantly from cardiac complications and death,    mandating hemodynamic stability throughout    surgery.190,191    Although the role of regional anesthesia in ERAS has    gained interest in recent years, there remains no clear evidence favoring regional (spinal, epidural, or peripheral    nerve blockade) or general anesthesia over the other. Individual studies have suggested specific benefits from    regional anesthesia: these include attenuation of the    neuroendocrine response to surgery,192 reduction in    blood loss,193 improvement in pulmonary function,194    reduction in myocardial ischemia,195 enhancement of    lower limb blood flow,196 and reduction the incidence    of graft thrombosis and thrombotic response to surgery.197,198 Evidence of possible long-term benefit from    regional anesthesia remains elusive, and there are data    to suggest that the type of anesthesia given for peripheral vascular surgery does not significantly affect cardiac    morbidity or mortality, overall mortality, or LOS.193,198-200    However, an RCT of 50 patients found fewer intraoperative episodes of myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing infra-inguinal bypass surgery under combined    femoral and sciatic nerve blockade compared with general anesthesia.201    Whether choosing a regional or general anesthesia    approach, the intraoperative analgesic strategy should    include at least one or two simple non-opioid analgesics    such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, an a2-agonist, or    ketamine.202    Summary/Recommendation: Use a multimodal analgesic strategy that includes non-opioid analgesics and    regional anesthesia tailored the expected duration of    pain and postoperative course.    Quality of evidence: Moderate.    11. Goal-directed fluid therapy    Intraoperative fluid management is a fundamental part    of enhanced recovery programs, and both hypovolemia    and hypervolemia have been strongly associated with    significant postoperative complications. These include:    impaired peripheral organ perfusion, site infection, poor    wound healing, tissue edema, fluid overload, acute kidney injury and sepsis, as well as increased morbidity    and mortality, and longer hospital stay in patients undergoing major abdominal and colorectal surgery.203-205    Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses including    observational studies and RCTs have shown that goalJournal of Vascular Surgery McGinigle et al 11    Volume -, Number -    directed fluid therapy decreases postoperative morbidity    and mortality in surgical patients,206 as well as reduces    both the volume of fluids administered and the incidence of complications, while still protecting renal    function.205    Patients presenting for infrainguinal arterial operations    are fundamentally physiologically different from the general cohort of patients presenting for major abdominal    and colorectal surgery; they are often older with multiple    coexisting comorbidities. Furthermore, the nature of surgery is different. Subgroup analysis has shown no evidence to support the use of goal-directed fluid therapy    in peripheral vascular surgery patients; however, basic    physiological principles apply to this high-risk group of    patients. Avoidance of intraoperative hypotension,    defined as a 40% decrease from pre-induction mean    arterial blood pressure with a cumulative duration of    more than 30 minutes, and prevention of fluid overload    are fundamental to avoiding adverse outcomes in this    patient group.207,208    Suggestion: Routinely use cardiac monitoring (arterial    line and non-invasive cardiac output monitoring such    as stroke volume variation) to support euvolemia.    Quality of evidence: Low.    12. Body temperature management    Perioperative hypothermia (core body temperature <36 C) is a result of cold operating room temperatures, exposure of the patient, and anesthesia-related impairment    of central thermoregulatory control. Hypothermia leads    to cardiac arrhythmias, coagulopathies, altered levels of    consciousness, decreased drug metabolism, impaired    renal function, leftward shift in the hemoglobin oxygen    saturation curve, resulting in reduced oxygen delivery,    and prolonged wound healing and increased SSIs.    From a combination of RCTs and prospective and retrospective cohorts across many surgical specialties, there is    evidence that maintaining normothermia reduces these    undesired outcomes.209 Strategies to maintain normothermia include preoperative warming (10 to 30 minutes    prior to induction of anesthesia), intraoperative warming    with a forced air heating blanket, and use of fluid    warmers and pre-warmed irrigation.209    Suggestion: Use multiple strategies to maintain normothermia, including prewarming and active warming of    patients intraoperatively.    Quality of evidence: Moderate.    13. Surgical access and techniques    Autologous blood salvage. In contrast to recommendations for aortic surgery,2,210-212 there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of autologous blood    salvage in lower extremity bypass cases, due to typically    lower operative losses associated with these infrainguinal    procedures.43,44,213    Groin incisions and closure. Groin incisions are prone    to infections and surgical morbidity, and reported rates    in literature range widely from approximately 3% to    30%.214,215 A Cochrane Review of two RCTs that    included 283 groin incisions found with low certainty    that transverse incisions for the exposure of the common    femoral artery resulted in fewer SSIs.216 Another metaanalysis that included the same 2 RCTs and added 5    case-control studies compared transverse with longitudinal incisions in 5922 groins and found that transverse    incisions had significantly lower incidence of surgical site    infection (0.73% vs 3.68%; P ? .03) and wound dehiscence, but that lymphatic complications were similar    (8.58% vs 10.9%; P ? .87).217    Multiple techniques are described in literature to optimize groin closure to reduce the risk for SSIs. A systematic review of eight RCTs shows that use of plastic    adhesive skin coverings with or without antimicrobial    properties does not reduce the incidence of SSIs.218    Meta-analysis of 17 RCTs and seven observational studies    noted that subcuticular sutures for skin closure had a significant reduction in SSI rates when compared with surgical clips or transdermal sutures (odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI,    0.17-0.65; P ? .001).219 When evaluating adjuncts to    closure, closed incision negative pressure wound therapy    significantly reduced the risk of SSI compared with standard dressings (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.23-0.51; P <    .001).219 Use of local antibiotics, fibrin glue, silver alginate    dressings, and platelet-rich plasma have inconsistent results, but have not shown any statistically significant effects on SSI rates in metanalysis.219-223    Similarly, a Cochrane Review of three RCTs demonstrates there is no evidence usage of drains will decrease    groin incision complications.224    Patients at high risk for groin incisional complications    (females, patients with obesity, patients with end-stage    renal disease) may benefit from prophylactic sartorius    muscle flap closure.225,226 Although incisional breakdown was similar between the groups, the presence of    a vascularized muscle flap overlying the vascular repair    was associated with reduced need for reoperation and    allowed more wounds to be managed with local wound    care alone.    Suggestion: Avoid the use of drains in groin incisions.    Level of Evidence: Moderate.    Suggestion: When possible, use transverse groin incisions. Close groin incisions with subcuticular sutures    and use a negative-pressure dressing.    Level of Evidence: Low.    Vein harvest. Along with the choice of conduit, the    technique of vein harvest is equally critical. The largest    retrospective study used the VQI database and evaluated    5066 patients from 2003 to 2013. Single continuous incision was used in 48.6%, skip incisions were used in 39.7%,    12 McGinigle et al Journal of Vascular Surgery    --- 2023    and endoscopic vein harvest was used in 12.7%. There    was no difference in SSIs in the three groups, but there    was a statistically significant reduction in patency of    endoscopically harvested veins at 1 year.227 Other retrospective studies have also demonstrated a reduction in    patency of endoscopically harvested veins when used for    lower extremity bypass.228,229    Suggestion: Harvest vein conduits with either continuous or skip open incisions rather than endoscopic    harvest.    Level of evidence: Low.    Hybrid surgery. Hybrid surgery has had a rapid increase in the treatment of PAD and should be considered in patients who are high risk for traditional open    surgery, but have lesions that may not be completely    amenable to endovascular intervention.230 Although    hybrid surgery is increasingly utilized, the population is    very heterogeneous, and the data are limited, which    reinforces the importance of case selection and treating    patients with complex PAD at centers equally capable    of both open and endovascular approaches. The most    commonly described hybrid infrainguinal revascularization is a common femoral artery endarterectomy    with endovascular revascularization of the femoropopliteal artery segment. A retrospective study of    4478 patients undergoing either venous bypass or    prosthetic bypass or hybrid revascularization found that    patients that are submitted to a hybrid intervention are    older than the other groups and more likely to be    treated under regional anesthesia. Compared with    those undergoing a hybrid approach, prosthetic bypass    was associated with more deep SSIs, organ space    SSI, postoperative sepsis, and unplanned 30-day readmission, and vein bypasses were associated with more    superficial SSIs.231 Similarly, a retrospective analysis of    1480 patients from the National Surgical Quality    Improvement Program registry demonstrated superior    short-term outcomes, especially with reduction of SSIs,    with a hybrid approach.232 A retrospective analysis of    850 propensity-matched patients from the VQI    demonstrated that hybrid revascularization was associated with a lower rate of myocardial infarction and    renal complications, shorter hospital LOS, and higher    rate of discharge to home compared with bypass.230    The 1-year outcomes suggested that patients in the    bypass group had a higher likelihood of improvement    in ambulatory status compared with patients in the    hybrid group (16.7% vs 7.7%; P ? .044); however, survival    analysis showed no difference in overall survival or    amputation-free survival between the two groups. A    non-randomized prospective study of infrainguinal    hybrid revascularization in 99 patients with chronic    limb-threatening ischemia demonstrates high technical success rates, and patency at 2.5 years matches    that of other reported infrainguinal bypasses.233    Suggestion: Hybrid surgery and distal endovascular    revascularization can be considered in older patients    and may reduce SSIs.    Level of evidence: Low.    POSTOPERATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS    14. Multimodal analgesia and opioid reduction.    Regional anesthesia is thought to be superior to general    anesthesia for early acute postoperative pain management and side effects; however, the evidence for    improved patient satisfaction is limited.234 There is    good quality evidence to support multimodal analgesia    for postoperative pain relief following surgery.187 These    techniques combine regional anesthetic techniques and    non-opioid analgesics at multiple points in the pain    pathway.235 A Cochrane review identified a 20% to 25%    reduction in pain intensity and a 30% to 50% reduction    in analgesic consumption in surgical patients treated    with a multi-modal strategy.236 The use of clonidine is    associated with reductions in pain, opioid consumption,    and early postoperative nausea and vomiting.237    Acute pain management in vascular surgery patients    with underlying chronic ischemic pain can often be challenging particularly in the postoperative period. One 30-    day postoperative follow-up study showed that 61.3% of    preoperative opioid users and 28.4% of opioid-na?ve patients continued using opioids.238 Given a 35% prevalence of chronic opioid use among patients with PAD    and because revascularization often eliminates ischemic    pain, a concerted effort should be made to taper existing    pain medications.239    Suggestion: Routinely use multimodal analgesic regimens to improve pain control and reduce opioid    consumption.    Level of Evidence: High.    15. Oral feeding. Postoperatively, patients should be    encouraged to reestablish oral nutrition as early as    possible, allowing patients to eat what they feel comfortable with and consume oral nutritional supplements    daily. Patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia    undergoing either endovascular or open revascularization that have improved postoperative nutritional status    fared better, even when their baseline nutritional status    was poor.13    Suggestion: Resume oral nutrition as early as possible, if    not immediately postoperatively, allowing patients to eat    what they feel comfortable with and consume oral nutritional supplements daily.    Level of Evidence: Moderate.    16. Glycemic control. Patients may benefit from incorporating a dietician to provide nutritional counseling, a    nurse diabetic educator, and endocrinology for patients    who have known diabetes mellitus. Perioperative hyperJournal of Vascular Surgery McGinigle et al 13    Volume -, Number -    glycemia in vascular surgery patients has previously been    defined as a glucose value of greater than 180 mg/dL    within 72 hours of surgery.240 The presence of perioperative hyperglycemia is strongly associated with increased    30-day mortality (5.7% vs 0.7%; P < .01), SSIs (5.7% vs 2.6%;    P ? .01), increased rates of renal failure, postoperative    stroke, and need for readmission.240 The prevalence of    peripheral arterial disease in patients with diabetes    mellitus is estimated to be 29%, with amputation rates in    diabetic patients being five to 10 times higher than in    non-diabetic patients.54,241 Improving glycemic control    provides for reduced numbers of SSIs, facilitates wound    healing, and provides better patient outcomes. Even in    the absence of a known diagnosis, most guidelines    support starting insulin therapy intraoperatively and    postoperatively for a blood glucose of >180 g/dL in supported hospitalized patients with a target of between    140 and 180 g/DL for most patients.242,243 Careful postoperative glycemic control to limit extreme variability in    glucose decreases adverse cardiac events244; however,    caution is advised as aggressive treatment causing hypoglycemia may increase mortality.117,245    Suggestion: Glycemic goal of 180 mg/dL or less during    the perioperative period.    Quality of evidence: Moderate.    Suggestion: Routinely use diabetic and nutritional    counseling as part of interdisciplinary care for diabetic    patients.    Quality of evidence: High.    17. Urinary drainage. Due to concern of catheterassociated urinary tract infection and guidance from    the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the use of prolonged urinary catheters has    decreased.246 Although urinary catheters are often    needed intraoperatively, there is little need for continuous postoperative urine output monitoring after lower    extremity bypass, and catheters should be removed at    the end of the operation, or as soon as possible in    extenuating circumstances.    Suggestion: Remove urinary drainage catheters before    leaving the operating room, or as soon as possible in    extenuating circumstances.    Level of evidence: Low.    18. Early mobilization. PAD, and especially the more    severe chronic limb-threatening ischemia, can lead to a    significant decrease in a patient¡¦s baseline functional    status. Evaluating the baseline functional status and    setting appropriate goals and expectations is imperative    to a successful postoperative mobility plan, and is associated with long-term independence and survival.247    Clear communication of weight-bearing restrictions    and immediate availability of appropriate off-loading    shoes for patients with tissue loss who can partially or    fully weight bear avoids delay in postoperative    mobilization. Mobility is not necessarily limited to    ambulation, and especially for those who are non-weight    bearing, can include any active limb exercise. Depending    on the patient¡¦s clinical condition, this could consist of    simple interventions such as dynamic range of motion,    sitting at the side of the bed, or pivoting to a bedside    chair.248 Successful mobilization strategies require a    multidisciplinary approach, objective evaluation of patient safety and ability for early ambulation, and tracking    progress with a formal mobility scale.249 If patients are    not progressing, then causes of failure need to be    analyzed by the multidisciplinary team, including physical therapists, and corrective measures should be instituted quickly. Multi-disciplinary care teams for vascular    surgery patients have demonstrated improved outcomes when incorporating podiatry and wound care    centers.250,251    Suggestion: Use a formal plan for early mobilization    immediately postoperatively, with early physical therapy    involvement when needed.    Level of evidence: Low.    19. Discharge criteria and post discharge education.    Patients undergoing vascular surgery have 30-day readmission rates as high as 20% and up to one-half of    readmissions are deemed avoidable.252-254 In line with    fundamental ERAS philosophy, there is a published    conceptual model of preventing readmissions in vascular    surgery that includes patient education and timely    communication from the preoperative phase to the    postoperative phase of care.4 A Cochrane Review of two    RCTs concluded that written and verbal information on    specific care instructions, medication lists, and when to    seek medical attention at discharge significantly    increased patient knowledge and satisfaction.255,256 The    data on follow-up postoperative phone calls has been    mixed; a Cochrane Review of 33 studies of mixed methodology from different specialties was inconclusive;    however, no adverse effects of the invention were    reported.257    Suggestion: Utilize both written and verbal discharge    education, use follow-up phone calls with 24 to 48 hours    of hospital discharge, and arrange clinic follow-up with    both the surgeon and primary care at least once at    30 days postoperatively.    Level of evidence: Low.    SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION    The main purpose of this consensus statement is to    provide a framework from which to build a multidisciplinary program to implement best perioperative    practices for patients undergoing lower extremity    vascular bypass surgery. As demonstrated in other specialties, forming care teams to enhance patient    optimization and shared decision-making, focus on    physiologic stress minimization, and reduce variation in    14 McGinigle et al Journal of Vascular Surgery    --- 2023    postoperative convalescence promises to improve the    safety and outcomes for patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass operations.    This consensus statement defines current standards    based on the available medical literature, but there are    many gaps in the published medical knowledge specific    to this high-risk group of patients. Of the 36 practice suggestions made, only 11 are based on high-quality evidence. Although the few clinical studies available seem    promising, studies of high methodological quality are    needed. The lines of research to be developed could    include any of the ERAS elements or combined elements, but are particularly needed in pre-admission optimization, prehabilitation, preoperative carbohydrate    loading in diabetics, pre-anesthetic sedatives and analgesia, early mobility protocols, and post-discharge    education.    AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS    Conception and design: KM, OL, HD    Analysis and interpretation: KM, ES, KA, SA, AS, MT, KD, IS,    MD, CS, RU, SH, JS, OL, HD    Data collection: KM, ES, KA, SA, AS, MT, KD, IS, MD, CS, RU,    SH, JS, OL, HD    Writing the article: KM, ES, KA, SA, AS, MT, KD, IS, MD, CS,    RU, SH, JS, OL, HD    Critical revision of the article: KM, ES, KA, SA, AS, MT, KD,    IS, MD, CS, RU, SH, JS, OL, HD    Final approval of the article: KM, ES, KA, SA, AS, MT, KD, IS,    MD, CS, RU, SH, JS, OL, HD    Statistical analysis: Not applicable    Obtained funding: Not applicable    Overall responsibility: KM    REFERENCES    1.
