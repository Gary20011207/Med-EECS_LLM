Pulmonary aspiration, which causes chemical injury or 
pneumonitis in the lungs, is considered one of the most fatal 
complications during induction of general anesthesia [1]. To 
prevent this complication, most surgeons and anesthesiolo
-
gists recommend stomach emptying before surgery, and 
patients are given the common nil per oral (NPO) after mid
-
night instructions the day before the surgery.

Purpose:
 Overnight fasting prior to elective surgery is the traditional way of avoiding the risk of aspiration during 
anest hesia induc t ion. Howe ver, it c aus es ment a l and met ab olic st ress to p at ients. Therefore, we invest igate d t he s afet y 
and p otent ia l b enefits of t he pre op erat ive consumpt ion of a carb ohydrate drin k.
M ethods:
 This was a single-center prosp ec t ive, nonrandomized study with questionnaire. Pat ients scheduled for 
ele ct ive lap aros copic chole cyste c tomy were include d. There was no rest r ic t ion on age, underly ing dis e ases, and bi liar y 
drainage prior to surgery. They were preoperatively given either a carbohydrate drink or were instructed to fast from 
midnight b efore surger y. Per ioperat ive emot iona l st atus was me asure d using the v isu a l analog s c a le. 
Results:
 The 132 p at ients completed t he questionnaire, w it h 68 re ceiv ing t he c arbohydrate dr in k and 64 follow ing 
nil per oral after-midnight instruction. There were no postoperative complications related to preoperative drink 
consumption or the cholecystectomy procedure itself in both groups. There were no significant differences in all the 
ass ess ed fe elings p ostoperatively except t hat preop erat ive dis comforts, such as hunger and thirst, were sig nif ic ant ly 
more a lle v i ate d in the g roup of pre op erat ive consumpt ion of a c arb ohydrate drin k. 
Conclusion:
 Preoperative consumption of a carbohydrate drink was found to be safe and effective in allevi ating 
pre op erat ive dis comfor t in ele c tive surger y p at ients, including older p at ients and t hose w it h underly ing comorbidit ies, 
who were at greater risk for aspiration. Therefore, we recommend considering preoperative drink consumption as an 
a lternat ive to t raditiona l over night fast ing in ele c t ive surger y p at ients.

However, patients who fast often experience hunger and 
thirst during the wait time for surgery [2,3]. Moreover, fast-
ing induces metabolic stress and insulin resistance, which 
may increase risk of postoperative complications [4,5]. 
Therefore, at present, according to the guidelines outlined 
by the Cochrane Review 2003 [6], American Society of An- 
esthesiologists (ASA) 2017 [7], and Enhanced Recovery after 
Surgery (ERAS) [8], preoperative overnight fasting is not rec- 
ommended and can be shortened to six hours for solids and 
two hours for liquids. Moreover, preoperative carbohydrate 
loading, instead of clear water, is recommended before sur
-
gery.
However, for most surgeons and anesthesiologists, it is 
still challenging to disregard this traditional regimen of over
-
night fasting. Moreover, little consideration is given to the 
evidence-based guidelines, and NPO after midnight before 
surgery is still being imposed on surgical patients.
Objec tives
In this study, as medical trends are heading toward imple
-
menting ERAS protocol for patients, we aimed to demon
-
strate that preoperative oral carbohydrate supplements are 
safe and can improve the quality of life in our patients, who 
generally have a high risk of pulmonary aspiration.

Ethics statement 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
of Seoul National University Hospital (approval number: 
2007-030-1139). All patients were given written informed 
consent out- lining a full explanation of the procedure in the 
study.
Study design 
This was a single-center prospective, non-randomized 
study with questionnaire. It was described according to the 
TREND statement (https://www.cdc.gov/trendstatement/in
-
dex.html). 
Par ticipants 
A total of 170 patients were electively scheduled for 
laparoscopic or robotic cholecystectomy under general an
-
esthesia from April 2020 to November 2020. Patients who 
could not comprehend the study protocol or miswrote the 
questionnaire were excluded. There were no restrictions on 
age, ASA grade, history of abdominal surgery, and whether 
percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) or 
endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) was inserted 
before the surgery.
Patients were divided into the two following groups
The NPO and carbohydrate drink (CHOd) groups. First, we 
enrolled only the NPO group, because NPO from midnight 
was the traditional protocol for preoperative preparation, 
which requires patients to fast for at least six hours before 
surgery. After enrolling approximately 60 patients in the NPO 
group, we consulted with the anesthesiologists to change the 
traditional protocol to the ERAS protocol. Both departments 
approved a preoperative carbohydrate drinking protocol 
as safe as possible according to our hospital circumstances. 
Then, we enrolled patients in the CHOd group.
Study protocol
The NPO group fasted after midnight before the surgery, 
following the usual preoperative protocol. The CHOd group 
was instructed to consume a 200 mL CHOd (NuCARE NO-
NPO
TM
: 100 kcal solution containing glucose 25.6 g, sodium 
104 mg, and potassium 96 mg; DAESANG Wellife) at least 
two hours before surgery. For example, if the patients were 
scheduled for the first operation of the day, which started 
at 8 AM, or was expected to undergo surgery in the morn
-
ing, they consumed the drink by 6 AM. If the patients were 
scheduled for surgery in the afternoon, they consumed the 
drink by 10 AM.
Surgical procedure and postoperative management
Second-generation cephalosporin (1g iv) was injected for 
prophylaxis 30 minutes before the surgical incision. During 
the laparoscopic cholecystectomy, we used three trocars, 
which were inserted at the umbilical site (12 mm), epigastric 
area, and right mid-subclavian line (each 5 mm). We made a 
single 3 cm incision at the umbilicus for the robotic-assisted 
cholecystectomy. Gallbladder resection was performed fol- 
lowing the usual surgical procedure.
The patients were allowed to drink clear water six hours 
after surgery and were provided a regular diet the morning 
after surgery. The patients completed the questionnaire after 
they were transported to their respective wards from the sur- 
gical unit. In addition, postoperative laboratory assessment, 
such as hemoglobin level, white-blood cell count, platelet 
level, liver function test, blood urea nitrogen level, and cre - 
atinine level, was conducted to examine any postoperative 
complications. Patients with no postoperative complications 
were routinely discharged one or two days postoperation.
Q uestionnaires
Before the surgery, patients scored their feelings of anxiety, 
weakness, hunger, thirst, and discomfort on a scale from 0 
to 10 according to the 
visual analogue 
scale (VAS) [9]
 After 
surgery, patients were asked about nausea and pain in addi
-
tion to the preoperative questions. The variables of the ques
-
tionnaire were adapted from previous studies [
10,11
]. Both 
groups were asked to answer the questionnaire in the ward 
immediately before going to the surgical unit so that the two 
groups were in the same situation, and any feelings they had 
toward the surgery during that time could be compared with 
a minimal bias. The questionnaire was translated in English 
17
and provided (Supplement 1).
S ample size
Sample size was not estimated. Participants were recruited 
from April 2020 to November 2020 till the number of en
-
rolled NPO group reached about 60. 
Assignment method
Unit of assignment to study condition is a group of NPO or 
none. The earlier individuals were assigned to NPO group. 
There was no matching of the participants for two groups. 
Blinding (masking)
There was no blinding to study condition assignment.
Unit of analysis
The unit of analysis is same to the unit of assignment.
Statistical methods
The VAS score, which was a continuous variable, was pre- 
sented as a mean±standard deviation and compared using 
an independent t-test. P<0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. Nominal variables were compared using Pearson™s 
chi-square and Fisher ™s exact test analysis. IBM SPSS Statistics 
23.0 (IBM Corp.) software was used for statistical analysis.
Results
Par ticipants
Of the 170 patients who underwent elective laparoscopic 
or robotic cholecystectomy, 132 completed the question- 
naire. Among them, 64 and 68 were in the NPO and CHOd 
groups, respectively (
Table 1
). Variables in the preoperative 
demographics were comparable between the two groups, 
except for the preoperative diagnosis. Overall, the patients 
were middle-aged (mean, 57.27±12.95 years; range, 24
Œ
84 
years); 44.7% had comorbidities according to ASA classifica
-
tion, with 31.1% of them diagnosed with critical diseases, 
such as neurovascular, cardiopulmonary, renal, and hepatic 
diseases that required surgical interventions. Further, 24.2% 
had a history of abdominal surgery, which might affect the 
outcome of cholecystectomy.
Preoperative radiology diagnosis revealed that calculous 
cholecystitis was the most common case (34.8%), and acute 
cholecystitis accounted for only 6.8%. For some patients 
initially diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, biliary drainages 
were performed before surgery (7.6% PTGBD or ERBD). 
There was no open conversion case.

M ain results
Operative data and postoperative complications
Most patients (88.6%) underwent the laparoscopic proce- 
dure with three trocar insertion methods (
Table 2
). According 
to the intraoperative findings, gallbladder stones and inflam- 
mation were observed in 71.2% and 42.4% of the patients, 
respectively. Patients with severe inflammation had drains in- 
serted (n=26) at the operative site. There were no significant 
differences in operative data between the two groups.
There were no postoperative complications related to pre- 
operative drink consumption or cholecystectomy procedure 
itself, such as pulmonary aspiration, pneumonia, vomiting 
after surgery, bleeding, infection, and bile leakage that could 
lengthen the patient™s hospital stay. The mean hospital stay 
was 1.93±1.00 days (data not shown).
Evaluation of perioperative emotional status
Perioperative emotional status was measured using the VAS 
system (
Table 3
). In the CHOd group, the preoperative VAS 
of only hunger and thirst scored significantly lower than that 
of the NPO group (hunger, P=0.035; thirst, P=0.001) before 
surgery (
Fig. 1
).
However, there were no significant differences in all the 
assessed feelings postoperatively, including postoperative 
nausea and pain (
Fig. 2
).
D iscussion
I nterpretation
In general, with advancements in surgical techniques and 
perioperative management, clinicians are beginning to focus 
more on improving the patients™ perioperative quality of life. 
Since the 1990s, ERAS or ﬁfast-trackﬂ programs have been 
introduced in various surgical fields to ensure early recovery 
from surgery or improve the catabolic conditions of patients 
[
12,13
]. Among the many issues considered in ERAS proto- 
cols, reducing perioperative NPO time has been one of the 
main principles in most surgical fields. Despite considerable 
efforts, we and many other centers have not adopted these 
evidence-based suggestions, and still instruct patients to fol- 
low the traditional regimen of overnight fasting before elec- 
tive surgery. However, we believe that the recommendation 
for overnight fasting should be discontinued.
Since general anesthesia inhibits coughing and airway re- 
flexes, reflux of gastric contents during general anesthesia in- 
creases the risk of lung aspiration. Therefore, it is a common 
practice for many surgeons and anesthesiologists to instruct 
the patients to fast for six to eight hours before surgery. How- 
ever, the operation time is not exact for each patient, and if

the surgery is delayed, certain patients are required to fast 
for more than the expected time. These patients are required 
to endure the inconveniences associated with such a delay, 
including hunger and thirst, in addition to the fear of the 
surgery. Furthermore, prolonged fasting may lead to a cata- 
bolic reaction that is similar to the condition after trauma. 
For example, increased insulin resistance or catabolism may 
increase the risk of postoperative complications [5,
14
].
Comparison with previous studies
Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of a 
preoperative CHOd in various aspects, such as stabilizing 
the emotional [2,3,
10,11
] and metabolic [
15,16
] states of 
patients. Hausel et al. [2,
10
] reported that carbohydrate re
-
duces preoperative hunger, thirst, and anxiety. Likewise, the 
present study revealed that the preoperative consumption of 
a carbohydrate-containing drink alleviates preoperative hun
-
ger and thirst, which are the main factors of discomfort that 
affect patients immediately before surgery [
17
].
Although previous studies support the safety and feasibility 
of preoperative administration of carbohydrate-rich drinks, 
most of them examined patients with a low aspiration risk. 
However, since our center is a tertiary hospital, patients 
tended to be older, had more comorbidities, and had a his
-
tory of abdominal surgery or inflammation in the gallbladder. 
Older patients usually have more functional gag reflexes than 
that in younger patients. In addition, patients who have un
-
dergone abdominal surgery or had gallbladder inflammation 
may cause abnormal bowel motility, increasing the risk of re
-
flux. Thus, we needed to confirm that a preoperative CHOd 
was also safe in our cohort. However, perioperative compli
-
cations were not observed, and longer hospital stay was not 
required for these patients.
We adopted a questionnaire based on the VAS score sys- 
tem since this system is convenient and simple for patients 
to answer and for physicians to evaluate patients™ symptoms 
and thoughts. Moreover, it is widely used to evaluate periop- 
erative discomfort variables, such as thirst, hunger, anxiety, 
nausea, and pain [3,
10,18,19
].
Limitations
There were some limitations in this single- center study. 
First, the time to answer the questionnaire differs between 
patients. For example, patients who were scheduled for sur- 
gery in the afternoon may feel more discomfort than those 
with a scheduled surgery in the morning. Since the start 
time of the surgery could not be controlled, it was difficult 
to tightly control the 2 to 3-hour interval between drinking a 
carbohydrate solution and the actual time of surgery, which 
might affect patients™ feelings and the subsequent VAS score. 
Thus, we requested the patients to provide the time when 
the questionnaire was completed and excluded those with a 
response time that deviated too much. Second, we included 
patients with cholecystitis via a PTGBD insertion. Although 
there is no data on patients with intraabdominal inflamma- 
tion for this type of study, preoperative consumption should 
be avoided in these patients since intraabdominal inflamma- 
tion negatively affects the bowel. Third, most previous stud- 
ies provided the patients with 400 mL of CHOd before 
surgery instead of 200 mL, which was given to the patients 
in our study. This might affect the results of our study, as the 
volume of the drink given to the patients may be insufficient 
to cause any complications. However, we can conclude that 

patients who are older and have comorbidities and inflamma
-
tion. Lastly, we could not calculate the actual sam- ple size for 
this study, but extrapolated it from the study of Hausel et al. 
[2] in 2005. Since the VAS score is used for the ordinal data, 
there was no information about the true mean and standard 
deviation from previous studies, but only me- dian value or 
interquartile range. Thus, future research would be needed 
with the corrected sample size according to this study.

Conclusion
This study demonstrated that oral liquid consumption of 
200 mL is safe and does not cause aspiration during anesthe- 
sia induction. It also reduced preoperative discomfort, such 
as hunger and thirst, thereby increasing patients™ quality of 
life. Thus, based on the findings of our study and previous 
studies, we can discontinue the traditional practice of over- 
night fasting prior to surgery to reduce patients™ perioperative 
discomfort.
