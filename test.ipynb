Strong recommendation for an ERAS\\nitem is possible even with low quality of evidence if the\\nrisk of harm is negligible[34−36] (Table 2). In case of any\\ndisagreements in assessing the quality of evidence and\\ngrading of recommendation statements, the following pro-\\ncedures were performed: (1) this was either resolved\\nthrough consensus discussions, or (2) when the disagree-\\nments persisted, by a Delphi process[37].\\nWe were judicious when providing strong recommenda-\\ntions in areas where there was weak procedure-speciﬁc evi-\\ndence to ensure that new nonevidence-based traditions\\nwithin ERAS were not created.\\nResults\\nThe electronic database search for the 22 ERAS items\\nyielded 66,432 articles. Forty-six thousand one hundred ﬁfty-\\none abstracts were screened after duplicates were removed.\\nTwo hundred ﬁfty-six articles were included in the develop-\\nment of the consensus statement.
