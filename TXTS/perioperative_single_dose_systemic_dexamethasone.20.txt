ABSTRACT
Background: Dexamethasone is frequently administered in the
perioperative period to reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting.In contrast, the analgesic effects of dexamethasone are not well de-fined. The authors performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the dose-dependent analgesic effects of perioperative dexamethasone.Methods: We followed the PRISMA statement guidelines. A
wide search was performed to identify randomized controlledtrials that evaluated the effects of a single dose systemic dexa-methasone on postoperative pain and opioid consumption.Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model. Ef-fects of dexamethasone dose were evaluated by pooling studiesinto three dosage groups: low (less than 0.1 mg/kg), intermedi-ate (0.11–0.2 mg/kg) and high ( /H113500.21 mg/kg).
Results: Twenty-four randomized clinical trials with 2,751
subjects were included. The mean (95% CI) combined effectsfavored dexamethasone over placebo for pain at rest ( /H113494h ,
/H110020.32 [0.47 to /H110020.18], 24 h, /H110020.49 [/H110020.67 to/H110020.31]) andwith movement ( /H113494h ,/H110020.64 [/H110020.86 to/H110020.41], 24 h, /H110020.47
[/H110020.71 to/H110020.24]). Opioid consumption was decreased to a
similar extent with moderate /H110020.82 (/H110021.30 to /H110020.42) and
high/H110020.85 (/H110021.24 to /H110020.46) dexamethasone, but not de-
creased with low-dose dexamethasone /H110020.18 (/H110020.39–0.03).
No increase in analgesic effectiveness or reduction in opioid usecould be demonstrated between the high- and intermediate-dose dexamethasone. Preoperative administration of dexameth-asone appears to produce a more consistent analgesic effect com-pared with intraoperative administration.Conclusion: Dexamethasone at doses more than 0.1 mg/kg
is an effective adjunct in multimodal strategies to reducepostoperative pain and opioid consumption after surgery.The preoperative administration of the drug produces lessvariation of effects on pain outcomes.
ACUTE postoperative pain is an undesirable outcomethat can delay functional recovery for patients under-
going surgical procedures. Multimodal analgesic approaches* Instructor, Department of Anesthesiology, Northwestern Uni-

have been used as an important strategy to mitigate postop-
erative pain.1The effectiveness of adjunct agents, including
ketamine,2gabapentin,3paracetamol, and nonsteroidal an-
tiinflammatory drugs,4have been examined in systematic
reviews that demonstrate their benefits in reducing postop-erative pain and/or opioid consumption. These agents be-came useful multimodal analgesic strategies.
5Dexametha-
sone is a corticosteroid commonly used perioperatively toreduce postoperative nausea and vomiting
6and may have a
beneficial role in postoperative analgesia. However, in a sys-tematic review of dexamethasone after laparoscopic cholecys-tectomy, the postoperative analgesic effect of dexametha-sone, examined as a secondary outcome was found to beinconclusive.
7Therefore, the effect of dexamethasone on
postoperative pain as well as the optimal dose to reduce painhas not been clearly defined. Currently, dexamethasone isnot recommended as a component of a multimodal drugstrategy to decrease postsurgical pain.
The objective of this quantitative systematic review was to
assess the efficacy and dose dependency of single-dose peri-operative dexamethasone on postsurgical pain outcomes. Wealso evaluated the dose-dependent side effects of single dosedexamethasone in the perioperative period.
Materials and Methods
This quantitative systematic review was conducted followingthe guidelines of the PRISMA statement.

Systematic SearchPublished reports of randomized trials evaluating the effectsof dexamethasone on surgical postoperative pain weresearched using the National Library of Medicine’s PubMeddatabase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, andGoogle Scholar inclusive to September 1, 2010. Free text andMeSH terms “dexamethasone,” “pain,” “postoperative,”“preoperative,” “analgesia,” and “opioid” were used individ-ually and in various combinations. No language restrictionwas used. The search was limited to randomized controlled clin-ical trials in subjects older than 18 yr. An attempt to identifyadditional studies not found by the primary search methods wasmade by reviewing the reference lists from identified studies. Nosearch was performed for unpublished studies. This initialsearch yielded 211 randomized clinical trials.
Selection of Included Studies
The study’s inclusion and exclusion criteria were determinedbefore the systematic search. Two authors (GDO and MDA)independently evaluated the abstract and results of the 211articles obtained by the initial search. Articles that wereclearly not relevant based on our inclusion and exclusioncriteria were excluded at this phase. Disagreements on inclu-sion of the articles were resolved by discussion among theevaluators. If an agreement could not be reached, the disputewas resolved with the help of a third investigator (HTB).Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
We included randomized controlled trials of a single periop-erative intravenous dexamethasone administration with aninactive (placebo or “no treatment”) control group. Ex-cluded were trials reporting analgesia after emergency medi-cine, dental, and nonsurgical pain. Trials evaluating morethan one dose of perioperative dexamethasone were also ex-cluded to maximize clinical homogeneity. Studies containinga concurrent use of an alternative multimodal analgesia reg-imen were excluded if a direct comparison of dexamethasoneand placebo could not be established. Included studies had toreport at least pain scores or opioid consumption on postop-erative pain outcomes. No minimum sample size was re-quired for inclusion in the meta-analysis.
Validity Scoring
Two authors (GSD and MDA) independently read the in-cluded reports and assessed their methodologic validity using amodified Jadad five-point quality scale.
9The scale evaluates the
study for the following: randomization, double-blind evalua-tion, concealment of study group to evaluator, valid randomiza-tion method, and completeness of data at follow-up. Discrep-ancies in rating of the trials were resolved by discussion amongthe evaluators. If an agreement could not be reached, the disputewas resolved with the help of a third investigator (HTB). Be-cause only randomized trials were included in the analysis,the minimum possible score of an included trial was 1 and themaximum was 5. Trials were not excluded or weighted in theanalysis based on quality assessment scores.
Data Extraction
Two authors (GDO and MDA) independently evaluated the fullmanuscripts of all included trials and performed data extractionusing a data collection form specifically developed for this review.
Discrepancies were resolved by discussion between the
two investigators (GDO and MDA). If an agreement couldnot be reached between the two investigators, the decisionwas made by a third investigator (HTB). Data extracted fromtrials included dexamethasone dose and time of administra-tion, sample size, number of subjects in treatment groups,follow-up period, type of surgery, early pain scores ( /H113494h )a t
rest and at movement, late pain scores (24 h) at rest and atmovement, cumulative opioid consumption, time to opioidadministration (minutes), length of hospital stay (hours),and adverse events. Postoperative opioid consumption wasconverted to the equivalent dose of intravenous morphine.

Visual analog scale or numeric rating scale of pain were con-verted to a 0–10 numeric rating scale.
Data were initially extracted from tables. For data not
available in tables, attempts to contact authors were made; ifthe authors did not respond or did not have current contactinformation, the data were abstracted from available figures.Dichotomous data on the presence or absence of adverseeffects was extracted and converted to incidence while con-tinuous data were recorded using mean and SD. Data pre-Dexamethasone for Postoperative Pain

sented only as median and range were converted to means
and SD using previously described methodology.11When
required, the SD for pain scores was estimated using the mostextreme values. The most conservative value was used whenthe same outcome was reported more than one time for adetermined period. Dexamethasone dose was converted tounits in mg/kg using the mean weight reported for the dexa-methasone groups. When no information about groupweight was available, 70 kg was used.
To facilitate a quantitative analysis and to examine dose de-
pendency of the outcomes, comparisons were stratified by doseinto three groups: low-dose ( /H113490.10 mg/kg), intermediate-dose
(0.11–0.20 mg/kg), and high-dose ( /H113500.21 mg/kg) dexameth-
asone. The dosage ranges were derived from clinical guidelinesfor postoperative nausea and vomiting that favor low dose com-pared with intermediated dose dexamethasone for antiemeticprophylaxis.
6The high-dose group represents doses greater than
those routinely used for antiemetic prophylaxis.
Definition of Relevant Outcome Data
Primary Outcomes. Early acute postoperative pain scores
(visual analog scale or numeric rating scale) at rest and atmovement (0–4 h postoperatively); late acute postoperativepain scores (visual analog scale or numeric rating scale) at restand at movement (24 h postoperatively); and cumulativeopioid consumption (up to 24 h) in the postoperative period.Secondary Outcomes. The time to first analgesic administration
(minutes); time to hospital discharge (hours); and incidence andseverity (visual analog scale or numeric rating scale) scores of chronicpain. In addition, adverse events including postoperative infection(wound, urinary tract, and pneumonia), hyperglycemic events, de-layed healing, and pruritus were examined.
Meta-analyses
The standardized mean differences with 95% CI were determinedand reported for continuous data. For dichotomous data (adverseeffects), the Peto odds ratio (to account for the potential of zerocounts in the cells for low-frequency outcomes) and 95% CI arereported. A significant effect compared with placebo required thatthe 95% CI for continuous data did not include 0 and for dichot-omous data, the CI did not include 1.0. We calculated numberneeded to harm, based on the absolute risk reduction, with 95% CIas an estimate of a harmful effect. We used the lower 95% CIestimate of the number needed to harm to describe the largest in-crease in adverse events that could be excluded by our analysis.Because of the different surgical procedures, we used a randomeffect model in an attempt to generalize our findings to studies notincluded in our meta-analysis.
12Publication bias was evaluated by
examining for asymmetric funnel plots using the Egger regressiontest.
13A one-sided P/H110210.05 was considered an indication of an
asymmetric funnel plot. A file drawer analysis described byRosenthal
14was performed in the case of an asymmetric funnel
plot. The test estimates the lowest number of additional studies thatif they would become available would reduce the combined effect tononsignificance assuming the average z-value of the combined Pvalues of these missing studies would be 0.
14Sensitivity analysis was
also performed to assess the effect of the elimination of a single trialon the outcome of the analysis.
Heterogeneity of the included studies was considered to be
present if the I
2statistic was greater than 30%. Further analysis
was planned a priori to explore relevant heterogeneity. Sub-
group analysis was performed to investigate the effect of time ofdexamethasone administration (preoperative vs.intraoperative)
on the pain outcomes. A Qstatistic was used to compare the
effects between subgroups. The proportion of the total varianceexplained by the covariates (R
2) was calculated by dividing ran-
dom effects pooled estimates of variance ( /H9270squared) within
studies by total variance (total /H9270squared). The value obtained
was then subtracted from 1. When values fall outside the rangeof 0–100%, they were set to the closest value (0% or 100%).
Comparisons between the different doses of dexametha-
sone and were made using a Z test with Bonferroni correc-tion for multiple comparisons. Analysis was performed usingComprehensive Meta-analysis software version 2 (Biostat,Englewood, NJ).
Results
Of the 211 initially evaluated abstracts, 38 studies initiallymet the inclusion criteria (fig. 1). Fourteen studies were sub-sequently excluded: 12 either had no acute pain outcomes,

data could not be extracted, or authors could not be
reached15–26; one trial used multiple doses27; and one trial
evaluated oral dexamethasone.28The characteristics of in-
cluded studies are listed in table 1. The evaluated trials in-cluded data from 2,751 subjects and were published between1997 and 2010.
29–52The median number of patients in the
included studies receiving dexamethasone was 40. The me-dian modified Jadad scale score was 4. The trials tested asingle dose of dexamethasone given either preoperatively orintraoperatively in a large variety of surgical procedures. All24 studies reported on opioid consumption and/or painscores. Six studies reported pain scores for both rest andactivity.
30,31,38,39,43,45
Early (0 – 4 h) Pain at RestThe overall effect of dexamethasone on early pain at restcompared with placebo favored dexamethasone with amean difference (95% CI) of /H110020.32 (/H110020.46 to /H110020.18)
(fig. 2). The funnel plot did not demonstrate asymmetry,indicating that there was not substantial publication bias
(P/H110050.43) (fig. 3).
The aggregate effect of the six studies evaluating low-
dose dexamethasone on early pain at rest
29–34did not
achieve statistical significance at /H110020.33 (/H110020.70 to 0.04)
of dexamethasone compared with placebo (fig. 2). All thestudies assessed dexamethasone given intraoperatively.Post hoc sensitivity analysis demonstrated that removal of
the study of Thangaswamy et al.
30would change the anal-
ysis to result in a significant effect of /H110020.42 (/H110020.81 to
/H110020.03) for low-dose dexamethasone compared with
placebo.
The effect of the combined 11 studies examining the
effect of intermediate-dose dexamethasone on early painat rest
29–31,35–42suggests a decrease in early pain of
/H110020.33 (/H110020.52 to /H110020.13) compared with placebo. There
was no difference in the effect of time of drug administra-tion on early pain and 38% of the total variance in theeffect was explained by the time of drug administration.

2for the low-, intermediate-, and high-dose
grouping of studies was 68, 52, and 42, respectively.Dexamethasone for Postoperative Pain

The heterogeneity for studies evaluating the preoperative
administration was low ( I2/H110050) but it was high for studies
examining the intraoperative administration of the drug
(I2/H1100577).
Five studies evaluated the effect of high-dose dexametha-
sone on early postoperative pain at rest.31,39,42–44One
study44provided two comparisons that were included in the
analysis. There was a beneficial effect of dexamethasone onearly pain of /H110020.29 (/H110020.57 to/H110020.02). Dexamethasone was
administered intraoperatively in all of these studies. No dif-ference in effectiveness was found among the dexamethasonegroups on early pain at rest.Early (0 – 4 h) Pain at Movement
The overall effect of dexamethasone on early pain atmovement compared with placebo favored dexametha-sone with a mean difference (95% CI) of /H110020.64 (/H110020.86 to
/H110020.41) (fig. 4) The funnel demonstrated some asymmetry
(P/H110050.04) with one of the seven studies outside the
95% CI, indicating some heterogeneity favoring dexa-methasone; however, the low number of studies limitsthe potential for evaluating substantial publication bias(fig. 5).

estimate and uncertainty for the effects of low- (0.1 mg/kg or less), intermediate- (0.11–0.2 mg/kg), and high-dose (more than0.2 mg/kg) dexamethasone, respectively. Sample heterogeneity as assessed by the I
2for the low-, intermediate-, and high-dose
grouping of studies was 0, 0 and 74, respectively.

Two studies evaluated the effect of low-dose dexametha-
sone on early pain at movement,30,31showing a reduction
when compared with placebo, /H110020.43(/H110020.84 to /H110020.03).
Three studies assessed the effect of moderate-dose dexameth-asone on early pain at movement,
30,31,38showing a reduc-
tion when compared with placebo, /H110020.65 (/H110020.96 to
/H110020.35), and two studies evaluating high dose dexametha-
sone on early pain at movement31,39also demonstrated a
decrease in pain when compared with placebo, /H110021.09
(/H110021.77 to /H110020.42). There was no difference between the
effects of different doses of dexamethasone on early pain atmovement.
Late (24 h) Pain at Rest
The overall effect of dexamethasone on late pain at rest com-pared with placebo favored dexamethasone with a mean dif-ference (95% CI) of /H110020.49 (/H110020.67 to/H110020.31) (fig. 6). The
funnel demonstrated moderate asymmetry ( P/H110050.01) with 5
of the 25 studies outside the 95% CI with 2
40,41favoring
placebo and 331,35,42favoring dexamethasone (fig. 7).The effects of dexamethasone (compared with placebo)
on late pain at rest by dosing groups is presented in figure 6.Five studies examined the effects of low-dose dexamethasoneon late pain at rest.
29,30,31,33,45One study45provided two
comparisons and both were included in the analysis. A pos-itive effect on late pain at rest of /H110020.47 (/H110020.68 to/H110020.25)
was observed. There was no evidence of asymmetry in thefunnel plot ( P/H110050.15).
Twelve studies evaluated the effect of intermediate-dose
dexamethasone on late pain at rest.
30,31,35–38,40,41,45–48One
study48provided two comparisons and both were included in
the analysis. There was a decrease in late pain at rest of /H110020.41
(/H110020.80 to/H110020.03) compared with placebo. There was no evi-
dence of asymmetry in the funnel plot ( P/H110050.09). There was a
greater effect when dexamethasone was given preoperatively,/H110020.77 (/H110020.95–0.09) compared with intraoperative adminis-
tration,/H110020.007 (/H110020.12–0.11) ( P/H110210.001).

decrease in pain of /H110021.0 (/H110021.77 to/H110020.26) compared with
placebo. There was no evidence of asymmetry on the funnelplot ( P/H110050.14). All studies assessed dexamethasone given
intraoperatively. There was no difference in the effect on latepain when the high-dose dexamethasone was compared
with the moderate- ( P/H110050.13) or the low-dose ( P/H110050.14)
groups.Late Pain at Movement
The overall effect of dexamethasone on late pain at movementcompared with placebo favored dexamethasone with a meandifference (95% CI) of /H110020.47 (/H110020.71 to/H110020.24) (fig. 8). The
funnel demonstrated asymmetry ( P/H110050.003) with one study
43
favoring dexamethasone outside the 95% CI (fig. 9).
Three studies examined the effect of low-dose dexameth-
asone.30,31,45One of the studies45provided data for two
comparisons and both were included in the analysis. Low-dose dexamethasone demonstrated a reduction of /H110020.39
(/H110020.66 to/H110020.12) in late pain at movement. There was no
evidence of asymmetry on the funnel plot ( P/H110050.43).
Four studies examining the effect of moderate-dose dexa-
methasone
30,31,38,45also showed a reduction in pain of
/H110020.52 (/H110021.02,/H110020.03). However, the analysis was limited
by asymmetry ( P/H110050.05). Rosenthal analysis predicted that
14 missing studies would be required to change the analysis.There was no difference in the influence of time of drugadministration on the dexamethasone effects ( P/H110050.45),
with 18% of the total accounted variance due to time ofadministration. There was high heterogeneity in the effectwhen the drug was administered intraoperatively ( I
2/H1100589)
and low heterogeneity when the drug was administered pre-operatively ( I
2/H110050).
Four studies evaluated the effect of high-dose dexameth-
asone on late pain at movement,31,39,43,45demonstrating a
reduction in pain of /H110023.16 (/H110024.95 to/H110021.38). The analysis

95% CI, with 2 favoring placebo and 3 favoring dexametha-sone. There was no asymmetry in funnel plots for low-, mod-erate-, or high-dose dexamethasone subgroups.

was potentially affected by asymmetry of the sample ( P/H11005
0.01), indicating a publication bias for positive studies.Rosenthal analysis suggested that 104 missing studies wouldbe needed to increase the Pvalue above 0.05. Post hoc sensi-
tivity analysis demonstrated that removal of the Kardash et
al.
43study would result in a change in the effect of the high
dose dexamethasone group on late pain to /H110020.84 (/H110021.12 to
/H110020.56) when compared with placebo. With the Kardash et
al.43study included high-dose dexamethasone showed im-
provement in late pain at movement compared with the low(P/H110050.003) or intermediate ( P/H110050.004) dose; whereas with the
Kardash et al.study removed high-dose dexamethasone showed
improvement in late pain at movement compared with the low(P/H110050.01) but not intermediate ( P/H110050.26) dose.
Postoperative Opioid Cconsumption
The overall effect of dexamethasone on postoperative opioidconsumption compared with placebo favored dexametha-sone with a mean difference (95% CI) of /H110020.41 (/H110020.58 to
/H110020.24) (fig. 10). The funnel plot did not demonstrate asym-metry indicating that there was not substantial publication
bias ( P/H110050.35) (fig. 11).
Four studies evaluated the effect of low-dose dexametha-
sone on postoperative opioid consumption.
30,31,45,50One
study provided data for two comparisons, and both wereincluded in the analysis.
45No difference in opioid consump-
tion compared with placebo was found at /H110020.17 (/H110020.38 to
0.03). All of the studies evaluated dexamethasone adminis-tered during the intraoperative period.
Nine studies examined the effect of moderate dose dexa-
methasone on postoperative opioid consumption demon-strating an opioid-sparing effect of /H110020.82 (/H110021.22 to/H110020.42)
compared with placebo.
30,31,35,36,38,40,41,45,51Moderate-
dose dexamethasone also decreased opioid consumptioncompared with low dose ( P/H110050.003). When given in the
preoperative period, the mean effect of dexamethasone onopioid consumption was /H110020.9 (/H110021.15 to/H110020.72) compared
with/H110020.48 (/H110021.04 to/H110020.07) when given intraoperatively
(P/H110050.1), suggesting an advantage for preoperative admin-
istration. In addition, 46% of the between-studies variationin effect was due to the time of drug administration.
Five studies assessed the effects of high-dose dexametha-
sone on postoperative opioid consumption.
31,39,43,44,45One
study51provided data for two comparisons, and both were
included in the analysis. There was a reduction in postoper-
ative opioid consumption of /H110020.84 (/H110021.24 to/H110020.45) com-
pared with placebo. All studies included in the analysis evaluateddexamethasone administered intraoperatively. High- dose
dexamethasone reduced opioid consumption compared withlow dose ( P/H110050.002), but there was no difference in the
opioid-sparing effect when comparing moderate-dose andhigh-dose dexamethasone ( P/H110050.94).
Chronic Pain (3 Months or Longer)
None of the included studies reported on chronic pain.
Time to First Analgesic Administration (Minutes)
Four studies evaluated the effects of low-dose dexamethasoneon time to analgesic administration.
30,31,45,50One study45
provided data for two comparisons, and both were includedin the analysis. There was a prolongation of the time toanalgesic requirement when the low dexamethasone groupwas compared with placebo at 0.70 (0.01–1.39). There was
no evidence of an asymmetric funnel plot ( P/H110050.07). The
studies demonstrated high heterogeneity ( I
2/H1100589) but the be-
tween-studies variability could not be explained by the time
of drug administration.
Three studies evaluated the effect of intermediate-dose
dexamethasone on time to analgesic requirement,30,31,45
showing no effect on the time to analgesic requirement: 1.09(/H110020.2 to 2.41). There was no evidence of asymmetric funnel
plots ( P/H110050.21). The analysis was limited by high heteroge-
neity that could not be explained by time of administrationof dexamethasone ( I
2/H1100592). Only two studies evaluated the
effect of high-dose dexamethasone on time to analgesic re-

quirement: 0.72 ( /H110020.70 to 2.14).31,45The analysis was lim-
ited by the low number of studies and high heterogeneity(I
2/H1100592). Both studies evaluated dexamethasone given dur-
ing the intraoperative period.Time to Hospital Discharge (Hours)
Five studies examined the effect of low-dose dexamethasone ontime to hospital discharge compared with placebo.
30,32,34,45,50
One study45provided data for two comparisons, and both
were included in the analysis. The com bined data showed a
decrease in time to hospital discharge: /H110020.47 (/H110020.72 to
/H110020.2). The analysis was limited by the presence of an
asymmetric funnel plot ( P/H110050.04), with Rosenthal anal-
ysis suggesting 30 missing studies would be needed tochange the results.
Six studies assessed the effect of moderate-dose dexameth-
asone compared with placebo on time to hospital dis-charge.
30,35,36,40,45,47There was a reduction in time to dis-
charge,/H110020.47 (/H110020.91 to /H110020.04), and no evidence of an
asymmetric funnel plot ( P/H110050.40). Heterogeneity was high
(I2/H1100589), with 16% of the total variance attributable to the
time of drug administration. Only one study45that evaluated
the effect of high-dose dexamethasone on the time to hospi-tal discharge demonstrated a 5.5-h reduction when com-pared with placebo ( P/H110210.001).

cifically reported no difference in postoperative wound in-
fection,30,34and one study specifically reported no cases with
delayed wound healing.30One study reported no difference
in changes of blood glucose between the dexamethasone andplacebo group.
30
Among studies evaluating moderate doses of dexametha-
sone, two did not report on side effects,37,51two reported no
differences in adverse side effects,41,45eight specifically
reported no cases of postoperative wound infec-tion,
30,35,36,40,46–48,52and one reported the same incidence
of wound infection in the dexamethasone and placebogroups,
38resulting in a 0.2% (0.05% to 1%) incidence of
postoperative infection for both the dexamethasone and pla-cebo groups. These numbers resulted in an overall risk dif-ference (95% CI) of 0% ( /H110021.2% to 1.2%) between the
moderate dose dexamethasone group and saline. The lowerestimate of the 95% CI of the number needed to harm is 83,therefore indicating that we can exclude one additional caseof wound infection in fewer than 83 patients. Two studiesreported no difference in change of blood glucose
30,36and
four studies specifically reported no differences in woundhealing.
Among studies evaluating high-dose dexamethasone, one
study did not comment on side effects,
49two reported no
cases of serious side effects,39,45one specifically reported no
cases of wound infection or delayed wound healing,43and
one trial reported a single case of wound infection in theplacebo group and no case in the dexamethasonegroups
44These numbers resulted in an overall risk difference
(95% CI) of 0.3% ( /H110022.5% to 3.1%). The lower estimate of
the number needed to harm is 32, indicating that we can ruleout one additional case of wound infection in fewer than 32patients. Three studies
31,43,45showed no decrease in the
odds ratio (95% CI) for pruritus: 0.72 (0.2 to 2.1) comparedwith placebo.
Discussion
Several important findings emerged from our meta-analysis.First, intermediate-dose dexamethasone (0.11–0.2 mg/kg)had opioid-sparing effects. It also reduced early and late painboth at rest and at movement. Heterogeneity was partiallyexplained by the time of drug administration (preoperativevs.intraoperative). High-dose dexamethasone (more than
0.2 mg/kg) had opioid-sparing effects and also decreasedpain scores. We were unable to detect a difference in opioid use
for the low-dose dexamethasone (less than 0.1 mg/kg) whengiven intraoperatively despite a reduction in late pain at rest andat movement. There is evidence that a single perioperative sys-temic dexamethasone dose can be used as part of a multimodalpain strategy to reduce postoperative pain.
Our findings have important clinical implications be-
cause lower dose dexamethasone is commonly given intraop-eratively at the time of anesthesia induction to reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting.
6By giving intermediate
doses of dexamethasone (0.11–0.2 mg/kg), beneficial effectson postoperative pain and a reduction in opioid consump-
tion in addition to decreased nausea and vomiting can beachieved.
7The decreased variability in analgesic effectiveness
when moderate-dose dexamethasone was administered pre-operatively favors preoperative rather than intraoperative ad-ministration of the drug. This finding is consistent with thetime to peak effect of dexamethasone (45 min to 1 h). Apotential limitation to the preoperative administration ofdexamethasone is that it can frequently (50–70%) produce
extreme perineal pain when given rapidly in low volumes.
53
This effect can be avoided if the dexamethasone dose is di-luted in 50 ml saline solution and infused over 10 min.
54
In a comparison, the high-dose dexamethasone group re-
duced late pain at movement compared with the intermedi-ate dose, but did not show a significant advantage in opioid-sparing effects, early pain at rest and at movement, and latepain at rest. Dexamethasone was administered intraopera-tively for all of the studies evaluating the high-dose group,which limited our ability to investigate the influence of thetime of drug administration on the outcome measures. Inregard to early pain at rest, the three dexamethasone groupshad similar point estimate reductions, but we were unable todemonstrate a statistically significant effect for the low dosegroup.
Our review provided evidence that a single dose of peri-
operative dexamethasone did not increase dose-limitingcomplications such as wound infection nor does it appear todelay wound healing. This conclusion is strongest for themoderate doses of dexamethasone because there are greaternumbers of patients studied at this dosing level. Our studycorroborates the safety assessment regarding postoperativewound infection and healing in a systematic review evaluat-ing a single dose of a different corticosteroid (methylpred-nisolone).
55Because we included several procedures and not
only contaminated surgeries, our findings cannot be gener-alized to patients at high risk of developing postoperativewound infection. Blood glucose alterations were specificallymentioned in only two studies, limiting any safety assess-ment on this important side effect.
Time to hospital discharge, an important outcome due to
its economic implications and affected by the presence ofpostoperative pain,
56showed a similar positive effect in both
low-dose and intermediate-dose groups. The analysis, how-ever, was limited by the presence of publication bias in thelow dexamethasone group, and by high heterogeneity in themoderate-dose group. It is conceivable that further reductionin postoperative pain could affect discharge time, althoughwe were unable to demonstrate this in our current analysis.
Our meta-analysis had several limitations. In an attempt
to generalize our findings to different surgical procedures, weincluded different types of surgeries that may have affectedthe heterogeneity in some of our analyses. Varying methodsof postoperative pain management across the studies wereanother potential source of heterogeneity. We could notdemonstrate a decrease in opioid-related side effects such asDexamethasone for Postoperative Pain
Anesthesiology 2011; 115:575–88 De Oliveira, Jr. et al . 586

pruritus because of the low number of studies by dosing
group reporting on these side effects. We also did not exam-ine the effect of dexamethasone on postoperative nausea andvomiting. We believe that this analysis would be biased by alarge number of studies that evaluated postoperative nauseaand vomiting but not postoperative pain and that were,therefore, excluded from our analysis.
Our quantitative review raises important questions that
need to be addressed in future studies. First, the effect of lowand high dose dexamethasone given preoperatively on post-operative pain needs further investigation. Second, side ef-fects such as wound infection and healing with high-dosedexamethasone, especially in open surgical procedures, needadditional evaluation. Third, because acute pain can contrib-ute to the development of chronic pain,
57studies assessing
the effects of dexamethasone on chronic postoperative painare also warranted. The data originated in the current studyshould be confirmed by large dose-ranging randomized clin-ical trials.
In summary, low-dose dexamethasone when given intra-
operatively does not have opioid sparing effects after surgery.High-dose dexamethasone (more than 0.2 mg/kg) whengiven intraoperatively has opioid-sparing effects and de-creased postoperative pain; however, it does not seem to beadvantageous when compared with intermediate (0.11 to 0.2mg/kg) doses. Intermediate dose dexamethasone (0.11 to 0.2mg/kg) is a safe and effective multimodal pain strategy aftersurgical procedures. The preoperative administration of thedrug provides a greater effect on postoperative pain.
