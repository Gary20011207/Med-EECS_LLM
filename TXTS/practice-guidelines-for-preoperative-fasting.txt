Methodology
De˜nition of Preoperative Fasting and Pulmonary 
Aspiration

For these guidelines, 
preoperative fasting
 is de˚ned as a pre
-

scribed period of time before a procedure when patients are 

not allowed the oral intake of liquids or solids. 
Perioperative 
pulmonary aspiration
 is de˚ned as aspiration of gastric con
-

tents occurring after induction of anesthesia, during a proce
-

dure, or in the immediate postoperative period. ˜roughout 
these guidelines, the term ﬁpreoperativeﬂ should be consid
-
ered synonymous with ﬁpreprocedural,ﬂ as the latter term is 
often used to describe procedures that are not considered to 
be operations. Anesthesia care during procedures refers to 

general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or procedural seda
-

tion and analgesia.
Purposes of the Guidelines
˜e purposes of these guidelines are to provide direction for 

clinical practice related to preoperative fasting and the use of 

pharmacologic agents to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspi
-
ration and to reduce the severity of complications related 
to perioperative pulmonar y aspiration. Clinical practice 
includes, but is not limited to, withholding of liquids and 
solids for speci˚ed time periods before surger y and prescrib
-
ing pharmacologic agents to reduce gastric volume and acid
-

ity. Enhancements in the quality and e˛ciency of anesthesia 

care include, but are not limited to, the utilization of peri
-

operative preventive medication, increased patient satisfac
-

tion, avoidance of delays and cancellations, decreased risk of 

dehydration or hypoglycemia from prolonged fasting, and 

the minimization of perioperative morbidity. Complications 

of aspiration include, but are not limited to, aspiration pneu
-

monia, respiratory compromise, and related morbidities.
Focus
Prevention of perioperative pulmonary aspiration is par t of  

the process of preoperative evaluation and preparation of the  

patient. ˜e guidelines speci˚cally focus on preoperative fast

Pr ac tice Guidelines
the administration of pharmacologic agents to modify the  
volume and acidity of gastric contents during procedures in  
which upper airway protective re˝exes may be impaired.
Air way management techniques that are intended to  
reduce the occurrence of pulmonar y aspiration are not the  
focus of these guidelines. For example, a rapid-sequence  
induction/endotracheal intubation technique or awake endo
-
tracheal intubation technique may be useful to prevent this  
problem during the delivery of anesthesia care. ˜e guide
-

lines do not address the selection of anesthetic technique, nor 
do they address enhanced recover y protocols not designed to  

reduce the perioperative risk of pulmonar y aspiration.
˜e intended patient population is limited to healthy 
patients of all ages undergoing elective procedures. ˜e 
guidelines do not apply to patients who undergo procedures 

with no anesthesia or only local anesthesia when upper air
-
way protective re˝exes are not impaired and when no risk 
factors for pulmonary aspiration are apparent.
˜e guidelines may not apply to or may need to be modi
-
˚ed for patients with coexisting diseases or conditions that can  

a˙ect gastric emptying or ˝uid volume (
e.g.,
 pregnancy, obesity,  

diabetes, hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal re˝ux disease, ileus or  
bowel obstr uction, emergency care, or enteral tube feeding)  
and patients in whom air way management might be di˛
-
cult. Anesthesiologists and other anesthesia providers should  
recognize that these conditions can increase the likelihood of  
regurgitation and pulmonar y aspiration, and that additional or  
alternative preventive strategies may be appropriate.
Application
˜ese guidelines are intended for use by anesthesiologists and 
other anesthesia providers. ˜ey also may ser ve as a resource 
for other health care professionals who advise or care for 
patients who receive anesthesia care during procedures.
Task Force Members and Consultants
In 2015, the ASA Committee on Standards and Practice 
Parameters requested that the updated guidelines published 

in 2011 be re-evaluated. ˜is current update consists of a 
literature evaluation and an update of the evidence-based 

guideline nomenclature. A summary of recommendations is 
found in appendix 1 (
table 1
).
˜e previous update was developed by an ASA-appointed 
Task Force of ten members, including anesthesiologists in  
both private and academic practice from various geographic  
areas of the United States and consulting methodologists from 

the ASA Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters.
˜e original guidelines and the previous update in 2011 
was developed by means of a seven-step process. First, the 
Task Force reached consensus on the criteria for evidence. 
Second, original published research studies from peer-
revie wed journals relevant to preoperative fasting and pulmo
-
nar y aspiration were revie wed and evaluated. ˜ird, expert 
consultants were asked to: (1) par ticipate in opinion surveys 
on the e˙ectiveness of various preoperative fasting strategies 
and pharmacologic agents and (2) review and comment on a 
draft of the guidelines developed by the Task Force. Fourth, 

opinions about the guideline recommendations were solic
-

ited from a random sample of active members of the ASA. 

Fifth, the Task Force held an open for um at a major national 

meeting
⁄
 to solicit input on its draft recommendations. 
Sixth, the consultants were sur veyed to assess their opinions 

on the feasibility of implementing the updated guidelines. 

Seventh, all available information was used to build consen
-

sus within the Task Force to ˚nalize the updated guidelines.
Availability and Strength of Evidence
Preparation of these guidelines followed a rigorous methodologi
-

cal process. Evidence was obtained from two principal sources:  

scienti˚c evidence and opinion-based evidence (appendix 2).
Scienti˜c Evidence.
 Scienti˚c evidence used in the devel
-
opment of these updated guidelines is based on cumulative  

˚ndings from literature published in peer-revie wed journals.  

Literature citations are obtained from healthcare databases,  

direct internet searches, Task Force members, liaisons with  

other organizations, and from manual searches of references  
located in revie wed ar ticles.
Findings from the aggregated literature are repor ted in 
the text of the guidelines by evidence categor y, level, and 

direction and in appendix 2 (
table 2
). Evidence categories 
refer speci˚cally to the strength and quality of the 
research 

design
 of the studies. Categor y A evidence represents results 

obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Cat
-

egor y B evidence represents obser vational results obtained 

from nonrandomized study designs or RCTs without per
-

tinent comparison groups. When available, Category A evi
-

dence is given precedence over Category B evidence for any 

par ticular outcome. ˜ese evidence categories are fur ther 

divided into evidence levels. Evidence levels refer speci˚cally 

to the strength and quality of the summarized study 
˜nd
-
ings
 (
i.e.,
 statistical ˚ndings, type of data, and the number of 

studies repor ting/replicating the ˚ndings). In this document, 

only the highest level of evidence is included in the summary 

report for each inter vention-outcome pair, including a direc
-

tional designation of bene˚t, harm, or equivocality.
Category A.
 RCTs report comparative ˚ndings between 
clinical inter ventions for speci˚ed outcomes. Statistically 

signi˚cant (
P 
< 0.01) outcomes are designated as either ben
-
e˚cial (B) or harmful (H) for the patient; statistically nonsig
-
ni˚cant ˚ndings are designated as equivocal (E).
Level 1:
  
˜e literature contains a su˛cient number of 
RCTs to conduct meta-analysis,

 and meta-
analytic ˚ndings from these aggregated stud
-

ies are repor ted as evidence.

Pr ac tice Guidelines
Level 2:
  
˜e literature contains multiple RCTs, but  
the number of RCTs is not su˛cient to con

duct a viable meta-analysis for the purpose of  
these updated guidelines. Findings from these  
RCTs are reported separately as evidence.
Level3:
  
˜e literature contains a single RCT and 
˚ndings are repor ted as evidence.
Category B.
 Observational studies or RCTs without per
-
tinent comparison groups may permit 
inference
 of bene˚cial 
or harmful relationships among clinical interventions and 

clinical outcomes. Inferred ˚ndings are given a directional 

designation of bene˚cial (B), harmful (H), or equivocal (E). 

For studies that report statistical ˚ndings, the threshold for 
signi˚cance is 
P 
< 0.01.
Level1:
  
˜e literature contains obser vational compari
-
sons (
e.g.,
 cohor t, case-control research designs)  

with comparative statistics between clinical  

inter ventions for a speci˚ed clinical outcome.
Level2:
  
˜e literature contains noncomparative 

obser vational studies with associative statis
-

tics (
e.g.,
 relative risk, correlation, sensitivity 

and speci˚city).
Level3:
  
˜e literature contains noncomparative 
obser vational studies with descriptive statis
-
tics (
e.g.,
 frequencies, percentages).
Level 4:
  
˜e literature contains case repor ts.
Insu˚cient Literature.
 ˜e 
lack
 of su˛cient scienti˚c evi
-
dence in the literature may occur when the evidence is either 
unavailable (
i.e.,
 no per tinent studies found) or inadequate. 

Inadequate literature cannot be used to assess relationships 

among clinical inter ventions and outcomes because a clear 

interpretation of ˚ndings is not obtained due to method
-

ological concerns (
e.g.,
 confounding of study design or 
implementation) or the study does not meet the criteria for 
content as de˚ned in the ﬁFocusﬂ of the guidelines.
Opinion-based Evidence.
 All opinion-based evidence (
e.g.,
 
sur vey data, open for um testimony, internet-based comments, 

letters, and editorials) relevant to each topic was considered in  

the development of these updated guidelines. However, only  

the ˚ndings obtained from formal sur veys are repor ted in the  

current update.
Opinion surveys were developed by the Task Force to 
address each clinical intervention identi˚ed in the docu
-

ment. Identical surveys were distributed to expert consul
-
tants and a random sample of ASA members.
Category A: Expert Opinion.
 Survey responses from Task 
ForceŒappointed exper t consultants are reported in sum
-
mar y form in the text, with a complete listing of consultant 

sur vey responses reported in appendix 2 (
table 3
).
Category B: Membership Opinion.
 Sur vey responses from 
active ASA members are reported in summar y form in the 

text, with a complete listing of ASA member sur vey responses 

reported in appendix 2 (
table 4
).
Sur vey responses from exper t and membership sources 
are recorded using a 5-point scale and summarized based on 
median values.
**
Strongly Agree:
 Median score of 5 (at least 50% of the 
responses are 5)
Agree:
 Median score of 4 (at least 50% of the responses 

are 4 or 4 and 5)
Equivocal:
 Median score of 3 (at least 50% of the 

responses are 3, or no other response category or com

bination of similar categories contain at least 50% of 
the responses)
Disagree:
 Median score of 2 (at least 50% of responses 

are 2 or 1 and 2)
Strongly Disagree:
 Median score of 1 (at least 50% of 
responses are 1)
Category C: Informal Opinion.
 Open forum testimony 
obtained during development of these guidelines, Internet-
based comments, letters, and editorials are all informally 
evaluated and discussed during the formulation of guideline 
recommendations. When warranted, the Task Force may 
add educational information or cautionary notes based on 

this information.
Guidelines
Preoperative Assessment

A preoperative assessment includes a revie w of medical 
records, a physical examination, and a patient sur vey or 
inter view. No controlled trials were found that address the 
impact of conducting a revie w of medical records, physi
-
cal examination, or sur vey/intervie w on the frequency or 
severity of perioperative pulmonary aspiration of gastric 
contents. Observational studies indicate that some predis
-
posing patient conditions (
e.g.,
 age, sex, ASA physical status, 
emergency surger y) may be associated with the risk of peri
-

operative aspiration 
(Category B2-H evidence).
1Œ5
 Observa
-
tional studies addressing other predisposing conditions (
e.g.,
 

obesity, diabetes, esophageal re˝ux, smoking history) report 

inconsistent ˚ndings regarding risk of aspiration 
(Category 
B1-E evidence)
.
6Œ11
˜e consultants and ASA members strongly agree that 
a revie w of per tinent medical records, a physical examina
-
tion, and patient survey or inter view should be per formed as 
par t of the preoperative evaluation. ˜ey also strongly agree 
that patients should be informed of fasting requirements and 

the reasons for them su˛ciently in advance of their proce
-
dures. In addition, both the consultants and ASA members 
strongly agree that veri˚cation of their compliance with the 
fasting requirements should be assessed at the time of the 

procedure.
** When an equal number of categorically distinct responses are 
obtained, the median value is determined by calculating the arith
-

metic mean of the two middle values. Ties are calculated by a 

predeter mined for mula.

State of the Literature.
 For the systematic review, poten
-
tially relevant clinical studies were identi˚ed 
via
 electronic 

and manual searches of the literature. Healthcare database 

searches included PubMed,Web of Science, Google Books, 

and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. ˜e 

updated searches covered a 6.5-yr period from Januar y 1, 

2010, through May 31, 2016. Search terms consisted of 

the interventions indicated above guided by the appropriate 

inclusion/exclusion criteria as stated in the ﬁFocusﬂ section 

of these updated guidelines. Only studies containing original 

˚ndings from peer-revie wed journals were acceptable. Edito
-

rials, letters, and other articles without data were excluded.
Two hundred ninety-eight ne w citations were identi˚ed 
and revie wed, with 42 ne w studies meeting the above stated  

criteria. ˜ese studies were combined with 133 pre-2010 

ar ticles used in the previous update, resulting in a total of  

175 articles found acceptable as evidence for these guide
-

lines. A complete bibliography of ar ticles used to develop  

these updated guidelines, organized by section, is available as 

Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/ALN/

B348.
For these guidelines, the 
primary
 outcomes of interest 
are pulmonary aspiration and the frequency or severity of 

adverse consequences associated with aspiration (
e.g.,
 pneu
-

monitis). Although controlled studies do not su˛ciently 

evaluate such relationships, the repor ted evidence does focus 
on intermediate outcomes, including gastric contents (
e.g.,
 
volume or pH) and nausea and vomiting, typically consid
-

ered by the authors to be representative of a predicted ﬁriskﬂ 
of pulmonary aspiration.
Results for each per tinent outcome are summarized and, 
when su˛cient numbers of RCTs are found, formal meta-

analyses are conducted. ˜e literature relating to seven evi
-
dence linkages contained enough studies with well-de˚ned 
experimental designs and statistical information to conduct 
formal meta-analyses. ˜ese seven evidence linkages are: 

(1) preoperative fasting of liquids between 2 and 4 h for 

adults, (2) preoperative fasting of liquids between 2 and 4 
h for children, (3) preoperative metoclopramide, (4) pre
-
operative ranitidine (orally administered), (5) preoperative 

cimetidine (orally administered), (6) preoperative omepra
-
zole (orally administered), and (7) perioperative ondanse
-
tron (intravenously administered). Outcomes assessed were 
limited to gastric volume, gastric acidity, nausea, and vom
-
iting (table 2).
General variance-based e˙ect-size estimates or combined  
probability tests were obtained for continuous outcome mea
-

sures, and Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios were obtained for  
dichotomous outcome measures. Two combined probability  
tests were employed as follows: (1) the Fisher combined test, pro
-

ducing chi-square values based on logarithmic transformations  

of the repor ted 
P
 values from the independent studies, and (2)  
the Stou˙er combined test, providing weighted representation  

of the studies by weighting each of the standard normal deviates  
by the size of the sample. An odds ratio procedure based on the  
Mantel-Haenszel method for combining study results using 2 x  

2 tables was used with outcome frequency data. An acceptable  
signi˚cance level was set at 
P 
< 0.01 (one-tailed). Tests for hetero
-
geneity of the independent studies were conducted to assure con
-
sistency among the study results. When signi˚cant heterogeneity  
was found among the studies (
P 
< 0.01), DerSimonian-Laird  
random-e˙ects odds ratios were obtained. To evaluate potential  

publishing bias, a ﬁfail-safe nﬂ value was calculated. No search for  
unpublished studies was conducted, and no reliability tests for  

locating research results were done. For ˚ndings to be accepted  

as signi˚cant, odds ratios must agree with combined test results  
whenever both types of data were assessed. In addition, ˚ndings  
from both the Fisher and weighted Stou˙er combined tests must  
agree with each other.
Consensus-based Evidence.
 For the previous update, con
-

sensus was obtained from multiple sources, including: (1) 
sur vey opinion from consultants who were selected based 
on their knowledge or expertise in preoperative fasting and 

prevention of pulmonar y aspiration, (2) survey opinions 

solicited from active members of the ASA membership, (3) 
testimony from attendees of a publicly-held open for um for 
the original guidelines held at a national anesthesia meeting, 
(4) Internet commentary, and (5) Task Force opinion and 
interpretation. ˜e sur vey rate of return is 59.7% (n = 37 

of 62) for the consultants (table 3), and 471 responses were 
received from active ASA members (table 4).

*These recommendations apply to healthy patients who are undergoing 
elective procedures. They are not intended for women in labor. Following 
the guidelines does not guarantee complete gastric emptying.
ƒThe fasting periods noted above apply to all ages.
⁄Examples of clear liquids include water, fruit juices without pulp, carbon
-
ated beverages, clear tea, and black coffee.
§Since nonhuman milk is similar to solids in gastric emptying time, the 
amount ingested must be considered when determining an appropriate 
fasting period.
**A light meal typically consists of toast and clear liquids. Meals that 
include fried or fatty foods or meat may prolong gastric emptying time. 

Additional fasting time (
e.g.,
 8 or more hours) may be needed in these 
cases. Both the amount and type of foods ingested must be considered 
when determining an appropriate fasting period.
For the previous update, an additional sur vey was sent 
to the consultants asking them to indicate which, if any, 
of the evidence linkages would change their clinical prac
-

tices if the guidelines were instituted. ˜e percent of con
-

sultants expecting no change associated with each linkage 

were as follows: preoperative assessment 95%; preopera

67%; preoperative fasting of breast milk 78%; gastrointes
